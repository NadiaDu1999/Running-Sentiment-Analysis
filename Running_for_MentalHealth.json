No more out of breath pauses in conversation or pounding chest.\n\n-I used to feel brain dead after a basic 5k midweek run, but now I go run 4-5 miles in zone 2 and I just jump back into work more easily. \n\n\nThe biggest shift for me has just been realizing how recovery works.

And it’s not even close.\n\n**Couch to marathon?**  \nThat can absolutely be done with consistency and a reasonable plan. Something like running three times a week — two shorter runs and one long run — for several months, and most people will be able to finish a marathon. It’s tough, sure, especially if you’re starting from zero. Your body has to get used to the impact, to being on your feet for 4–6 hours, and you need to avoid injuries along the way. But in many ways, it's a matter of gradually teaching your body to endure motion over time. Think “survive, not thrive.”\n\n**Marathon to Ironman?**  \nThat’s a whole different beast. You’re not just adding two more sports — you're multiplying the complexity, time commitment, and technical demands.\n\nYou need to:\n\n* Swim 3.8 km in open water, usually in a mass-start chaos with hundreds (or thousands) of others.\n* Ride 180 km on a bike — ideally a tri bike or at least a road bike with aerobars, because doing it on a regular road setup is asking for punishment.\n* Then *run* a full marathon… as the final act of the day.\n\nThis isn’t just “can I keep moving?” — it’s *can I perform all three disciplines, one after the other, over 10–17 hours, and still hold it together mentally and physically?*\n\nAnd training for that?  \nIt’s *relentless*. You’re training not just to move, but to:\n\n* Master technique in all three sports to avoid injury and burnout\n* Fuel efficiently (fat vs. sugar metabolism)\n* Learn gear, pacing, and recovery strategies\n* Balance it all with life, work, and sleep — which becomes its own discipline\n\nUnlike couch to marathon, where the main challenge is “get the body moving,” Ironman training is about building a machine that can go the distance without falling apart. It’s not just physical — it’s logistical, mental, and emotional. Your training week can easily hit 10–15 hours (or more), and it’s often more about *consistency* than intensity.\n\nSo yeah — couch to marathon is a big accomplishment.

Few things that helped me:\n\n\\- Do your runs outside. Spending that time in the sun makes it so much more enjoyable than staring at a treadmill screen and watching the mile counter tick up slowly. Seeing other runners is equally motivating, and the scenery helps take your mind off things.\n\n\\- be sure to adequately fuel your body. Being in the bulk/cut mindset, it's pretty easy to try to go without adding in bonus fuel on your run days but you'll burn yourself out and end up exhausted if you do. Have some electrolytes (I just use gatorade powder, it's cheap) and some carbs before you go out and you'll feel stronger.\n\n\\- build volume slowly. Start out at your 2mi per run, then every week or every other week add another .1-.2, just like you would with progressive overload. If it starts getting too much for each session, add another run in during the week but cut each down each day's volume so that your total weekly volume remains the same, and then start building back up again.\n\n\\- get proper running shoes. I got NB 1080Vs and they made a world of difference over just using any old athletic trainers.\n\n\\- eventually try experimenting with some interval training. Being able to have a \"rep\" scheme you're working towards may help it feel more like lifting did. 8x400m on a track is two miles, broken into laps, and you can add 1min rest between to catch your breath again.",

You’re using new muscles and tendons in a new way.\n\nSecond, research proper form and cadence. You are essentially letting gravity and momentum pull you forward, as you are taking your steps. It’s a series of single leg jumps, but it should be more of a pull with glutes/hamstrings rather than a push off with your quads.\n\nThird, since running is a single leg movement, I would recommend start incorporating running specific lifts in the gym, this really helped me get more springy. There is a ton of resources online, but single leg exercises are the gist of this (Bulgarian split squats, split squats, single leg RDLs, reverse/lateral lunges, single leg hip thrusts, etc.) Also train your soleius muscle in your calf, it takes a huge load while running. Also train your hip flexors and incorporate plyometrics. This will all help you feel more springy.\n\nFourth, is a mental shift which just takes time. I’m not doing cardio, but I am going on a run. Reshape it from cardio to just another type of exercise that you do and be purposeful with it.\n\nFifth, I like to run before leg days as to feel most fresh.\n\nSixth, go slow! Don’t focus on distance or pace, just focus on a couple slow miles multiple times per week. Conversational pace in general and walk if your breathing gets too heavy. Frequency is what you’re looking for right now.\n\nSeventh, eat some quick digest carbs before a run, and eat more carbs in general, especially as your mileage increases. If I’m running first thing in the morning I like half an English muffin with a bunch of honey, or an English muffin pb&j if I’m going more than five miles.",

A big person running a 12 minute mile can be working as hard as a lighter runner doing an 8 minute mile. Their heart rates might be the same. It's definitely a big ego hit to keep the HR in the right zone, and realize you could power walk at the same speed you're running at. I would play a game with myself where if my HR cap was 145 BPM, I would see how fast I could go without going over 145.\n\nThere are 2 types of mental runners: Distraction and zone. Distraction runners use music, audiobooks, podcasts, TV shows (if on a treadmill), etc. Zone runners intentionally use nothing and zone out on their run. I've done both. I'm currently a distraction runner. If you have a hard time staying mentally in the game while you run, remove your brain as a variable by giving it something enjoyable to focus on while you run. Also, distraction running doesn't work if you're running hard. Use HR monitors to keep your level of effort where it needs to be.\n\nTreat running as a skill and not just a fitness activity. Just like how squats and deadlifts are basic, fundamental body movements that have a surprising amount of skill involved, running is the same way. Improving the skill of running, the neuro adaptations, the connective tissue growth, etc., means you can perform better longer, which helps with the mental strain. Trying to run at your max output level drains your willpower really fast.

Strength training is about exertion, whereas cardio is more about relaxation.\n\nIf you sprint really fast, you have the same euphoric sensation of high performance over a short period of time that you get from lifting a heavy weight. This is why people practice HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) which trains VO2 Max, increasing your top speed. That's the kind of running you want to do if you want to \"feel the burn\" like you do with strength training. \n\nBut for slow speed cardio, the euphoria comes from the \"runner's high\" which comes from increasing your metabolism above resting levels, but below the point of lactic acid buildup. If you start to \"feel the burn\", you lose endurance fast. The strength training equivalent would be doing extended isometric exercise.   \nEndurance running is primarily practiced at the Zone 2 heartrate, or \"converstional pace\" where breath control shouldn't feel strenuous. Lots of people, me included, try to run at this pace, immediately feel it's too easy, speed up to Zone 3, and then immediately get winded. That'll make you feel like you can't run without taking breaks, when in reality your stable running pace is actually jogging.\n\nWhen I started running, I settled on doing HIIT walk-runs. And it was great for a while, until I got injured and had to quit completely, and get into strength training to reinforce my joints. If you're doing both, then you could probably give that a try if you can't get over the mental barrier of endurance cardio. But Zone 2 cardio gets more rewarding over time because once you find your correct pace, you stop feeling winded and you find the runner's high. I compare the sensation to smoking a cigarette, but significantly healthier.\n\nI recommend doing both. At least 1 HIIT session, and a gentle 5k jog per week. \n\nWith HIIT training, you won't feel bad for taking walking breaks. And it'll give you the satisfaction of pushing yourself.  \nFor endurance runs, instead of trying to run at your Zone 3 pace, crashing out and then trying to increase your ratio of running to walking each session. Try to jog an uninterrupted 5k. You don't get faster by trying harder, you get faster because your heart strengthens and pushes you farther for the same effort.

The difference between 6.0 and 6.5 on the treadmill might not seem like a lot, but you'll feel it at the end of the run, and you'll definitely feel it at the end of the week. Find a comfortable pace, and it's probably a lot slower than you'll want to admit to anyone, but that's okay. I actually really recommend the treadmill for this because you have exact control over the pace, so you can be consistent every time you go for a run. Pacing is the biggest struggle that beginners have.\n\n\n2) it gets easier. It takes a while but eventually running will become an autopilot thing. I'm currently focusing entirely on weightlifting. I run 2 miles a day for maintenance, and I don't even think about it. It's a little 20 minute part of my day. But it took me about 2 years to get here.

When I'm on the treadmill, I like watching sports even though I usually don't care about sports. Running outside is also nice obviously although it's harder to pace yourself as a beginner.

Mentally it is so much easier for me to think \"I only have to run 30 seconds or whatever and then I get to walk\" over and over vs \"I have to run continuously for x amount of time.\"\n\n\n-Buy a float run harness from PR Gear.

It's very cheap. \n\n\n-try trail running! \n\n\n-listen to music or watch a good show if running on the treadmill \n\n\n-find a running buddy \n\n\n-read Born to Run which will convince you that you should love running lol.

Once you have a baseline of fitness, and you really nail the breathing pattern, running becomes rhythmic and enjoyable.\n\nSome aids to get there when you are starting out (or restarting out as in after an injury):\n1. Embrace the run walk - at first running consistently is going to be hard - negotiate a run walk pattern and keep improving on it\n2. As many have said, run slower than you think you need to when you start doing durational jogs. Use the run walks or short days for speed work, but focus on steady chill heart rate (say no more than 145) for the long efforts\n3. Be smart and gradual! This is different strain and repetition and musculature than lifting. Your body/muscles might deceive you in the moment into thinking you can do more than your ligaments & IT band, shins etc are ready for. \n4. Eat more carbs, fuel your runs - if you feel zapped or like it’s grueling, you are likely underfueled or under slept.\n5. Accept that those first 5 minutes when you are moving from homeostasis to cardio is just going to suck most times. For a beginner that’s probably going to be the first 5-8 minutes of jogging. But, once you break past that and all systems are go it starts to get fun. It’s like running up a hill each time, the downhill & joy is just over the peak!\n6. With the above in mind, be thoughtful about your run walks - if you stop too soon all the time or recover too long walking, you are basically just putting yourself in that acclimating pain zone over and over and it’s going to feel torturous.\n7. Add complimentary plyometrics, HITT, and unilateral weight movements for your legs. Lots of good resources online\n8. Really do replace shoes every 300-500 miles. It’s expensive, it sucks, but not nearly as much as a stress fracture or strain.\n9. Music!! Find some good steady best songs that you enjoy and watch the endorphins multiply.\n\nGood luck and have fun!",

I was never a sporty kid growing up, and I found that I kinda developed a mentality that I was not athletic as an adult. Realizing that made my thoughts feel less overwhelming and guided the way I talk to myself now when I’m not motivated to run. This took a few months of running consistently to figure out, but now I can anticipate when certain thoughts will pop into my head during my runs. Like, pretty much every first mile of my runs, I’ll start to think that it’s too hard, or my body feels heavy or running just doesn’t feel good. Instead of beating myself up for having those thoughts, I can counteract them by saying “this is just the first mile, my body is still warming up, it will get better at the second mile.” Those thoughts have more weight than the doubts, because I know them to be true — the second mile always feels better than the first for me. \n\nCertain phrases help me push through more than others. Thinking “just do it,” or “you got this,” doesn’t motivate me at all. But phrases like “you can do hard things,” “do the work,” or “keep the promises you made to yourself,” really keep me going for some reason. So, try to find the phrases that mean something to you personally. I honestly love watching running “influencers” or pro runners to hear what mental shifts work for them. Sally McRae always says “do the work,” and that has stuck with me.

It’s difficult to over-hydrate during any race, but ultimately it’s up to the individual to feel out what works for them based on training and race conditions. Most people pause at aid stations frequently going 26.2, maybe only a couple times for 13.1. For pacing and momentum, anything besides gels/chews tends to slow things down rather than boost most runners. But your mileage may vary!",

Your splits look to me like your glycogen burn rate outstripped your fueling; this can be exacerbated by hills. \n\n2. Aim for 60+g of carbs/hr. Try it on a 10+ mile long run; I bet you’ll feel better and recover better. 30g carb gels every 3-4 miles will get you there. \n\n3. Try a handheld bottle to make hydration easier. You can put some drink mix in too (tailwind or similar) for some extra fueling. \n\n4. Try adding some hill strides 1-2x/week to your training after shorter runs. It’s a nice intro to speedwork with relatively low risk and high return.\n\nHow was the overall race experience and course? I visited northwest AR a few years ago to hike the Ozark Highland Trail and I’d love an excuse to visit again.",

But I'm leery of pushing myself in a long distance, if I start to burn out it's a long time to keep going - kind of like swimming far from shore it makes me nervous.  Your negative split plan seems good - I've generally just tried to keep it flat plus my usual loop course is a little uphill on the way back so even not slowing down feels like an achievement.\n\nBut anyway congrats - you really smashed through that time, it wasn't even close.  I'd be really happy with that.  You're probably even thinking you could do a sub 4 full marathon now right?  I might throw in a 20 mi once in a while to see how it is then just go for the full one day to cross it off but I've no aspirations to become a marathoner, it's just too long and too much time training.\n\nFor now I will continue to work on my shorter distances.  I'm just under 57:00 for 10K and I'm pretty sure I can get that a few minutes faster which give a lot of latitude for being a bit slower for the remaining 11K but still getting under 2 hours.

Replacing some of your easy runs with trail runs is a great mental health boost and gives a good variety of movement to your legs.

You could journal on your motivations for running - what it gives you in moments of need and where you would be without it. Boil it down to an essence and a strong mission for why you run. Then tap into that when you are not feeling like it. \n\n\n2) The other thing that helped me get out was joining a club and making plans to run with friends. I hate letting people down, so will always attend if I said I would even if I don't feel like. \n\n\n3) Even if you have a training plan, just allow yourself to do the bare minimum e.g. 3km easy run, and quit if you're not feeling it after that threshold. I rarely do quit but knowing I can is reassuring.\n\n\n4) Plan ahead of time - if you want to go for a morning run, lay out your clothes the night before. Even wear them to bed. Make it as easy as possible for you to get out of bed and go.\n\n\n5) plan some cool / more interesting/ different places to run. Sometimes when I'm not feeling like it the novelty of running in a new place will inspire me to go ahead and do it. So sometimes I will drive to a run just so it's more interesting scenery.",

It could be 3 sentences long if I'm lazy, or 3 pages if it was an eventful day. \n\nComing to the realization that it was the 45th day of journaling in a row, as someone who hadn't had a consistent habit in about a decade, it opened my eyes. \n\nSo after months of not running, I set a 5am alarm, every Monday Wednesday Friday Sunday, and now we're here, I've been running every 2 days for 4 months. \n\nAnd with that, some days I'll be away from home, at a social gathering, or whatever it may be. I don't force myself to play catch up the next day, but I'd often find myself itching for it because I miss it now. \n\nI'd also suggest running for time, not distance. In the start it was 1k, 2k, 5k, 10k etc. I realized I'd push myself too hard to achieve it. Instead of that, it was 10 minutes, 15, 30, 45, 60 etc. \n\nI'd also recommend turning off the option to see distance or pace on my watch, so I'd only know when I got home that it was X or Y distance.

(It should be mentioned that if I have a 45 minute run, and I feel like absolute shit, there may only be 15 minutes running, but there is 30 minutes of walking. 45 minutes is 45 minutes.) \n\nOverall, the most gruesome aspect of my depression, besides the occasional plan to kill myself, was the inability to keep a *loose* routine. Loose routines are half assing, in a time when you're already convincing yourself to half ass shit, it just doesn't work. \n\nLife gets in the way, there's nothing to stop that, but it's an adjustment in the moment, not an excuse. A \"set in stone\" routine via an alarm telling me to get up and go, well it took the agency away from me, it simply became a case of \"oh, time to grab the shoes\", instead of the \"oh, do I have it in me to go run when I get home?\", because realistically we'll find a reason to tell ourselves we don't have it.",

If not for a handful of friends doing the same thing, I wouldn't have, but we kept each other going (mainly using the Nike run app. We made a goal as a group, and then just cheered everyone else on.) This honestly might have saved my life. \n\nIn the last few years, I've maintained sobriety and have now run 3,000 miles.....which is totally nuts to me. I've never been a runner. It still sucks the first three miles. And I still don't call myself a runner.... I feel more like a stumpy little penguin toddling out there in the sun. She is going nowhere fast, y'all. But at least she's moving. 🐧\n\n(The only way I can do it at all is if I'm outside. The treadmill is the ultimate form of torture, to me. 😂Nature does some pretty cool sh*t to heal the brain, though, including how your eyes move, and what \"happy tree chemicals\" can do to rewire.) \n\nThe first step is the thing. I consider it a win if I go a step. Because I know when I least feel like running....that's exactly when I need to do. \n\nSo, I start tiny. Even if it's literally two blocks. Maybe it turns into a 3 minute walk. Letting myself be gentle with myself is hard-- and so is deciding to put on the shoes. But if I've committed to the shoes... I can usually do more than what I thought. \n\n\nLuckily, my husband is incredibly supportive and I still have that friend group. Sometimes, when it's really bad, and I just can't, I will at least force myself to go outside. If it's really bad, I might only make it to the front stoop. But a step is a step. And I build myself back up as best I can. You know how it is- depression comes and goes in waves, and so does  my ability. Sometimes I work my way up to doing 8 miles every day, sometimes I can't do it for two months. But, at least I can try to get to the front yard. Literal, albeit tiny, change of scenery. \"I went outside today. Maybe tomorrow I can get to the mailbox\" Tiny goals. \n\nFor me, I think it's ultimately about the gentleness paired with a kind community. The support of my people helps me stay kind and patient with myself. We all need a legitimate cheering squad. From people who really get it and are actually happy that you just got outside today.

Sometimes it’s harder then other times to stay focused on the daydream instead of the depression but the music does help and I try to force myself in it. The running makes me feel like I’m actually getting tired from battle & the emotions and scenarios in my daydream. I basically disassociate for as long as I can.\n\nBut depression is hard and there are a lot of different kinds and way people react to it. Don’t compare what you can and can’t do when you are depressed to that of others. Some may be more functional than others and some may have different ways to cope or get to the day. I’ve struggled for 14 years now and I still can’t be the person I want to be sometimes even though you fight so hard against that dark little beast in your head.",

Basically add the run to a habit you already do. For eg, if you walk your dog or cook food at a specific time, you go for a run right after. This makes it easier to build a habit onto an already existing habit. \n\nI also take a picture of myself after every run (I don’t have any social media so it’s not for vanity) and that visual always helps me remember how good I feel after every run. You don’t remember the good “feeling” as well as something tangible. You could try keeping a journal too, just write 1 sentence after every run if you can’t do too much. \n\nAll the best!",

I only recently started to run because I have heard so many stories how running helped them coped with depression and helped their mental strength. And yes, I do agree with them, it has been somehow helped me. I hated running because I didn't know how to run properly, didn't know how to pace myself properly.\n\nSlow runs and short runs at the beginning really helped me. No need to run some others like 10KM or an hour long run at certain pace. Forget about the duration, length and pace you are running. I have been starting with 10-15 mins run for such slow pace/conversational pace where you can run and talk. Only through this i found out why i hated running in the past, because I always tried to run fast immediately and I will instantly gassed out.  \n  \nAnd also I signed up for some short fun races like 2.4KM, 4KM Walk or 5KM runs. The overall environment during those race really helped me. How positive people are, how supportive people are, how nice people are when they don't even know me. Just running and being surrounded with these bunch of amazing people really helped me. Even completing those races, getting rewarded with medals, it just feels good. No matter how slow I completed it, it made me feel good about myself because finally I completed something I started without giving up.\n\nRemember, start slow, don't rush it. Yes, seeing our improvement in timing, endurance and strength makes us feel good. But, just enjoy the process and don't rush it. I got injured and I had to stop running until recover and this will actually make you feel really really depressed because it's making you feel like the world is taking away your joy when you finally found one. I am trying my best to stay positive, focus on recovery, because I know I can run again soon and back enjoying it.\n\nDon't be shy, ask people around how to run properly. They are more than willing to share and help you.\n\nEveryone has their own story behind depression and so far, running has been helping me.",

But I found the opposite, at my worse I found the mentally exhausting state of depression to manifest itself as physical exhaustion and found I literally could not see how I could keep putting one foot in front of the other.  I had to call my partner more than once to come in the car and collect me,  I am a pretty experienced runner and I was not particularly pushing myself, not running distance or pace that would explain this exhaustion which was out of all proportion to the effort I was making.  My best way of describing the sensation was the sort of physical weakness / like jelly legs that you experience during a dream when trying to run away from something.  Where you don't seem have enough basic strength in your legs to support your weight.  Really weird, and I am sure sounds nonsense to someone who hasn't experienced it .\n\nI'm managing my depression better now although it's always there, and now I don't as often get this point during my training.  So my take from this is.... Yes, mild depression and low mood, outdoor physical exercise is and was transformative for the positive, but I found at my fully depressed lowest it was the polar opposite as it further exhausted my mental/emotional and physical state to the point that I would just start crying during a run.  I know this is counter to what most people are saying but my darkest thoughts either when I was either drinking alcohol or running.  So I just now try to manage the difference in running when I am \"low\" to give me a boost which it does fantastically, or acknowledging when I am in a bad enough way that I could experience the opposite benefit.\n\nHope you find a way",

Every child is different and so is every person, any fitness lost can be regained in time.   \n  \nI'm curious on the overall litter consensus for races. With trail races obviously you hold on to all of your packaging and either unload it at an aid station or keep it for the entire race, but with road races I feel there is a different attitude towards litter mainly as most have cleanup crews specifically to take care of that and water stations always have hundreds of cups thrown to the side. If there are garbage bins at the side of the road you throw your stuff in the bins, but if there aren't, even at water stations do you still keep your packaging even when there's piles of garbage and people designated to pick it up?",

Yes, in the tunnel, staying at the center is best, and you really need to pay attention to the ground. Tripping on the potholes inside the tunnel could be quite bad for you, and for others around you.\n2. I used pretty worn Alphaflys and they worked quite well on the gravel. Except, you may catch some rocks entering your shoes. I had to stop and take off a shoe TWICE to get some rocks out of the shoe. I never ran in running gaiters, but imagine they would help. Whatever shoe you're using will wear significantly because of the gravel surface, so keep that in mind.\n3. Stryd pods set as the data source for pace and distance on my Garmin Epix Pro helped me a lot inside the 2.5 mile tunnel where GPS would not work.",

Debilitating chronic spine injuries in my 30s, inability to walk or even dress myself some of the time. I'm pretty far down a long, hard road to simply being functional and not in perpetual pain, but at the same time, why running as opposed to everything else involved in rehab? I run because I love running and I've always loved running. I raced the kids in my neighborhood around the block and sprinted up and down hills for fun from the earliest times I started forming memories. I lettered in four sports in high school, but running was the only one I really took seriously and did every year and the only one I continued in as an adult. For a while, I wasn't able to run, and I resigned myself to that reality and lived with it, found other ways to stay as active as was possible. But as long as I actually can run, I will. Along with climbing and throwing, it's one of the few athletic activities humans are naturally better at than most other animals. It's an expression of function and joy that our bodies are made for.

A pub / bar is fine to meet up at, but a cafe can be better, especially in the morning…\n\n-When you’re running with more than ~30-50 people you’d want different pace groups - slower for the chatters, faster for the more serious runners / those who still want to chat but want to go faster. A choice of pace groups allows for a mix of genders etc too. \n\n-Stuff! People love freebies / photos / social media works to spread the word. Honestly it gets a bit OTT in my opinion but partnering with a cafe can be nice to get some free coffees if you can. \n\n-Have fun. Don’t try and make it all about you, or even all about the running, or make it super prescriptive. Just let people get on with their run within the boundaries of a) a clear route that people at the front know, b) a clear pace that is mostly stuck to, c) a clear start and end time, and d) an agreement about whether you leave people behind who are slow or not (that actually sounds prescriptive but doesn’t need to feel like it).

When I joined my club 21 years ago it was predominantly male and mostly faster runners, which scared off the slower runners. We've worked really hard on this and we now have twice the membership, more or less even numbers male & female, ages from 18 to 91 and all paces. parkrun has really helped with this, as runners see people their pace running for clubs, and thus we've recruited many from there (we have 2 members who are local event directors which really helps). We've made sure our training is suited for all abilities - our speed sessions are based on time rather than distance and are run on loops or out & back courses, specifally so that no-one feels left behind. Out regular runs go out in pace groups, slowest first, and we always have a tail runner. Small changes that have a big difference in making the club feel inclusive.\n\nHowever, what I would say is that the club is predominantly middle-aged - we have way more members over 60 than under 30, and this seems quite common for road running clubs. If I look at our cross country league and the summer events we do with other clubs then the average ages will be closer to 50 than 30. Track clubs seem to be younger, but to be honest they only really cater for the top end - if you aren't going to be good enough to run for them in track meets then they aren't really interested. All the road runners from our local track club moved en-masse to us a few years ago because they simply weren't being catered for.\n\nThe simple fact is that most younger runners don't appear to be interested in running with clubs, particularly clubs full of older runners. They seem to think that because they can't commit to all training sessions they won't be welcome, but road running clubs really don't work like that - you pay your money and you come whenever you want - it's not like you need to keep coming to be in the team, because there isn't a team!

DNF at mile 20 due to physical and mental exhaustion. I just didn’t have that in me even tho I knew I could finish. It was a mentally draining week after. Couple things I did\n1. Posted in the community I trained with online and here on Reddit. You have a good supporting system even though you never met them in person trust me.  Just taking to people works \n2. Find distractions and don’t run until you don’t physically feel any pain. I took 6 days off. Couldn’t find any distractions cuz my work was too much to handle. It would’ve been better if I could.\n3. When back in running, try to run in your most comfortable way instead of crunching on time. The thing got me most frustrated was I couldn’t have a pleasant race. Doesn’t mean I want to feel comfortable during my race. Feeling hard is fine but running at wrong effort that eventually gets myself out is not. \n4. Find an another race. Some people don’t think it’s smart to do this I agree. But it works for me. But you have to do it wisely without damaging your body. I decided to run the postponed race 2 weeks after my DNF. Had a mindset of I had nothing to lose and adjusted my goal to just enjoy it. Finished with a PR tho way slower than my original goal. Used it as a trial to test things I’ve never done before so not hitting my original goal will not be end of the world. This really could be any distance. Just enjoy the feeling of getting something done could be helpful.\n\nAll of these are really personal to me might not apply to you. Hope you can find your own way with stories from all the good runners here!",

There were fewer electrolytes and fuel also. \n\nI figured the half would be busier than full…but the entire run was packed. Yall split around mile 9, I think, and then came back around 12.

They asked the water station if they were on the full route and the volunteers weren’t sure. \n\nFewer bands than last year. \n\nPolice were on point.

Given the sweltering heat of the day, this neglectful oversight by the Rock & Roll marathon organization placed countless participants at risk.\n\nSome had to stop and pour their own cups.

As someone who was right behind the person who collapsed and ultimately passed away, there’s a few things I noticed on this run. \n\nI really enjoyed the course, it was definitely tailored to the half. (Which I understand is most races) Didn’t enjoy combining back with the half marathon runners without having a warning. I stopped two other marathon runners who had turned around to let them know they were going the wrong way. (One of them had ran .7mi back) But I still really enjoyed running through downtown Nashville. Especially being from Nebraska. The hills aren’t as bad as what I’m used to.\n\nThe heat and humidity was something that got to me, being from the Midwest. My last few months of training have been in pretty cold temps. And the week before flying to Nashville we were still having lows of 40°s and highs of 60°s. I could definitely feel the heat on Saturday. \n\nAs for the aid stations, I waited twice to have a cup filled with either water or Gatorade. I was on pace right around 3:50-3:55. So I wasn’t the fastest and wasn’t the slowest, so to still have aid stations empty with cups is surprising. \n\nAs for as medical, not sure if anyone else has talked about it. For a race that’s put on/for St.Jude. I was disappointed with the location of the med tents, availability of AEDs. \n\nAt mile 22.6 another runner came running down the hill shouting for anyone who knew CPR and asking for medical. As someone who is certified and was certified in CPR in the past year I sprinted up the hill. Upon arriving to the group of people circled around the man on the ground, two runners had already started providing chest compressions trading off after every 30 compressions. And in between there were two women who were providing rescue breaths. The person next to me was on the phone with 911. (At this point it’s only runners tending to him) This goes on for about 2 minutes as we’re still waiting for medical. A medic was walking up the hill to us casually. I had to shout “He’s not breathing and doesn’t have a pulse” for the medic to actually start jogging. I assume he thought the person on the ground was just passed out or was cramping up. Not actually dying. Once he started chest compressions and the golf cart with more medical staff got there I realize I was useless and continued with my run. Trying not to get choked up, since I knew the situation was very serious especially without an AED. \n\nThis situation seems to happen often in long distance runs or strenuous activities. It’s just hard to believe there’s no other way for event organizers to better prepare for scenarios such as these. \n\nCondolence to his family and friends, he was only a year older than me.

I can’t relate to all the issues you had with your TBI, but going from an active lifestyle to being disabled so suddenly gives an overwhelming sense of impending doom. That the life you were living is over and nothing will be the same. While it’s true that nothing is the same, that doesn’t equate to a diminished life entirely. You are so right about how life continues no matter what mindset you have in any given situation. It’s easier to relish in your own misery than to adopt a newfound perspective directly attributed from personal trauma. I have more gratitude for the ability to walk and run than I’ve ever had in my life (and I’m currently still immobile, so I can’t do either yet). \n\nThis is all to say that, this injury has changed me as it did you. I do not plan to return to playing tennis in the capacity I was before being injured. I will still play for fun, but not in a competitive league anymore. However, I have a regained goal of running a marathon. It has been on my mind for years since I ran a half marathon in 2019. I took a break from running after that race and never got back on the wagon due to other interests like biking, weightlifting, and tennis. But now, this injury has made me realize that if I don’t challenge myself to go after this goal now, I may never get another chance. \n\nSo again, thank you for your heartfelt and brave story on overcoming all odds to reach your dreams.   You’ve motivated me to reach for mine!",

I'd had an injury that meant I couldnt run for all of January, so I started back up in Feb. I'd been feeling good in training, running 16-17km runs at consistent 6 minute kilometre pacing, so I'd hoped I was on for a 2:06 and had even been cautiously optimistic about going a little faster.\n\n My first couple of kilometres felt great, around a 5:40 pace, and then after that it felt like I completely lost my head - I had some issues with my headphones while in the starting pen so I was running without my music and had to play my strava out loud for pacing. Not ideal when I didn't want to disrupt anyone else and could hardly hear it over the crowds!\n\nI think it was a combination of not having run with other people before/getting distracted by the crowds/the heat that meant I completely lost my mojo and just couldn't push through to go any faster.\n\nI finished in 2:18 in the end. To be honest, I'm really happy that I managed to finish as I found it super tough at times. I did get very distracted by the crowds/high fiving/hitting power up signs so I did have an overall good time.\n\nThere's a lot of lessons for me to take away I think but I'm hoping to give it another go in about 5 weeks so fingers crossed!\n\nJust wanted to post my experience to let you know you're not alone in having something super similar happen - I can also commiserate with the weird mix of pride/disappointment in having finished (when it felt really tough) but also like... why did this happen!?\n\nRunning eh!?",

I know when I am trying to pick myself up and try again, I like to listen to podcasts or videos about people in similar situations. If you're the same, your story reminded me a bit of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzPVMvDyjWY) really positive story from Floberg Runs, a big theme in his many challenging marathons was dialing in fueling and issues but he got it down eventually. It also reminded me of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwVXQlwViao) video by Natacha Oceane who had some serious fueling issues repeatedly during races (spoiler: less happy, but at least you get to commiserate!) . \n\nMost of all, I hope these videos remind you that **what happened does not make you inadequate; it was a race day system failure, not a failure of you as a human.** Is your goal to do hard things or to run halves? Based on your talk about not wanting to be average, it sounds like your goal is to do hard things, and you crushed that goal! \n\n**Theories:** I have no clue what is wrong and I am less experienced than many on this sub, but I love theorizing and you asked for theories! Immediately when I read your stitch and nutrition plan I started to wonder if you were taking in enough water/electrolytes *or* too much haha. Yes a lot of people were saying the heat was bad but the fact that it happened *right* after the gels AND happened in your last half makes me think there's a deeper issue. At the very least you deserve to be confident going into your marathon that you've sorted it out.\n\n* Did you take *less* water with your gel than you normally do, perhaps due to not wanting to overdrink on race day? \n* Alternatively, did you drink *more* water than usual? Or perhaps you normally drink a tiny bit in sips but you took more in at once at the aid station?\n* Were you *lacking* electrolytes due to the heat? Can that cause stitches? (I feel like I've heard that it can and a quick google seems to agree). e.g. did you need some gatorade/sports drink? \n* Someone else on here mentioned breathing correctly - [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/eres4x/avoiding_side_stitches/) has the top two comments talking about that too. \n   * How quickly do you take your gel in on race day vs regular? Could that be making your breathing weird?\n\n**Testing:** Thoughts on doing a 10k or 10 mile run this summer so you can test out the stitching without having to fully commit? You may not normally fuel for a shorter race but I would for the sake of testing.\n\nYou also said your training peaked at 20km and didn't feel good there, but felt good after your 15k. How many weeks did you do over 10 mi (16km)? Are you doing enough long long runs to really (a) test and (b) feel ready to go fast at dist? \n\nAlso, another good way to test is to have some of your 2-3 hour (16km+) long runs before the race include 30-45 min \"faster\" running. There's lots of info out there about this, but it would also give you the chance to test your gels in a more \"race-like\" situation.",

The important thing is that you realized it, and now you can train intentionally to extend your endurance at 4:10 pace.  (fwiw, I'm at right about the same spot.  Garmin estimated my 5k time at 19:50.  I was skeptical so did a 5k leg test yesterday (5k hard in the middle of a 5 mile run) and did it in 20:16.

                    "body": "Years ago and having found myself in this sub without much explanation, there was a thread that was a rare moment where I had anything to contribute.  It was about why [I'd only run one marathon](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/lr35d1/one_and_done_marathoners_how_come/gojswma/).  If memory serves this was somewhere during the uncertain resurgence of the plague and so for the better part of a year *at least* running was one of the very few good things I could do for myself.\n\nAs you might guess if you read that post, I *fucking hated* running.  \n\nI didn't know it at the time I wrote that, but one of the really important things about running at that particular intersection of time and space was that it quite literally the *only* healthy thing I could do to shut my brain off about a question that'd I'd been running from for as long as I could remember which more or less went \"If you could be someone entirely different, wouldn't that be *better*?\"  The misery of the run itself distracted, and if I pushed hard enough, went *far enough*, there was nothing left in the tank for hypotheticals that exploded into infinite possibility with uncountable bad scenarios.  More and more I focused on every single thing that sucked about running:  how quickly my legs would voice their first complaint, the growing warmth on my knees, my hips, how there never seemed to be enough air.\n\nBut the more I focused on it, the more I realized that those first complaints weren't actually *bad*.  It was just a muscle making it known it was being heavily used.  And if I changed my pace just a tiny bit, slowed down *just a little*, breathing wasn't a desperate fight for survival.  Without realizing it, my relationship to running started to change.  For all my life it was *abuse*.  Arguably healthy, undeniably useful, but *abuse* nonetheless.  And yet when I started listening to my body as a way to distract me from the terrible question always mustering for yet another assault against defenses long shattered and nearly spent, it became well and truly calming.  I was just a system of parts set to motion by act of will.  This feedback meant I should change my stride, that feedback meant I could speed up, this other bit meant that I could slow down.  With this awareness, the sensations became a thing to consider because it was useful and then discard.\n\nI started *looking forward* to running, not purely as an escape, but because somehow when I was running, when so much of me was tied up thoughtlessly mediating the whole of the machine, I could extend that same dispassionate assessment to other things.  I experimented with that question, and I saw for the first time that the universe itself had not decreed that I be engaged in the long fight against it; I'd chosen to.  I picked apart why I thought I had to fight it.  I'd take the insights with me and write them down because somehow *that they happened during a run* meant they were *safe* to consider without fear or bias.  For the first time in a year, I didn't need to be drunk to go to sleep.\n\nIt was on a run that I first allowed myself to consider the possibility that I was transgender.  It was on a run that I grasped the most essential fear was losing my wife.  It was on a run that I made a plan to float the idea in parts.  The day I came out, I'd run almost 8 miles - the furthest I'd gone since I ran that marathon.  I then got drunk because what I had to do felt too much like heading to my own execution, and I came out.  And when the safe and comfortable plan for how life was going to go crumbled, instead of drinking until I couldn't think about it, I'd run, and I'd think about it, and whatever the next step was somehow transformed into a thing I *could* do.\n\nEarly on I picked up one of those weird running injuries and so had to not run for half a year to let things sort itself out.  I replaced it with other activity including some of the best hiking I've ever done, but I longed to return to running.  I'm back at it now, though, and my mileage is ticking steadily upward.  I'm almost certain to be slower and yet somehow the speed stopped mattering.  It stopped being a challenge leveled at the universe - a bet that I could *endure* sufficient suffering to complete a run - and became something else.  I am not spurred on by the odd bedfellows of hate and necessity and now I run because because it feels good, and because all those miles give you plenty of distance to give those really important things the sort of consideration they *need*.",

I restarted running after our second child was born when I was in my early 30s and realized how stupid I had been... and how much fun it is pushing jogging strollers.  I was super-proud to push a Double Bob for a 21:54 hilly 5k -- enough to set a new years commitment to get my 5k time down to 20:00 by the end of that year.  It took until October but I did it, and then subsequently ran my first marathons and half marathons.  \n\nFast forward ten more years, a cross-country move, a third child, and a number of years with no running and only basketball, cycling and weights for exercise and my older two are becoming competitive soccer players so I start running with them again, albeit inconsistently.\n\nFast forward to last year.  I was about to turn 46 and had been running pretty decently for a few months leading into the year (say 25-30mpw).  I tore my groin running 200s on a local track and was out of action for running or any sports requiring lateral motion from February until late August.  August was coincidentally when my oldest (9th grader) started his first HS XC season, having been convinced to join by a couple of 10th graders that he ran with in middle school.  It turns out my son is f'ing fast and now I had a real reason to start running in a serious way again.\n\nLong story short:\n\n* I'm proud and thankful that my 9th grader son has found a love for running, is self-motivated and serious enough about his health and performance to treat it with the respect it deserves as a competitive high school athlete.\n* I'm proud of myself for not being afraid to get started again, and to stick with it over the past several months until I now, where my conversational pace for a 13mi long run is ~8:00/mi and I recently set a 10k PR (43:08).  I'm not F-A-S-T, but I'm getting back to the point where I feel like I'm doing pretty darn well for a middle-aged dad.  I'm also thrilled to be able to run with my kids (or in the case of my 7yo, she bikes and I run), as long as my son is on a recovery day and I'm doing a tempo/threshold run.\n\nI like to take some credit, too, that it's my love of running that go my son interested initially, and helped him to become the stud he is now.  17:04 XC 5k (hilly course), 9:54 3200, 2:05 800, and he's confident he's going to bring his 4:42 1600 down to the low 4:30s at tomorrow's meet.  He's approximately top 25 in the state of California for freshmen, and now he's got inspiration (from seeing the upperclassmen around him) to work toward potentially running in college.\n\nAs parents, we've always harped on the importance of nutrition and recovery as long as our kids have been old enough to understand those words, but it wasn't until this year when our oldest started his high school running that he really understood and internalized it.  It becomes very obvious, very quickly if you're daily training for an aerobic endurance sport that you can't cut corners and you can't cheat your body for very long without suffering consequences.  This is setting him up for a lifetime of healthy choices, and that's awesome!",

If I ever went over my calorie threshold I'd exercise (or...take other actions) but that only happened a couple of times a month. Then when I went into inpatient treatment, I had a lot of \"movement restrictions\" and extra monitoring, so I never really knew how to move my body in a joyful way. At one point they wouldn't even let me do yoga!\n\nI did track in HS but then didn't run for 10 years. My ED resulted in an arrhythmia (usually benign but I will have it for life) and just in general some scary electrolyte and heart stuff. This year I really wanted to get my heart healthy and try to undo some of the damage.\n\nI started running, and rather than triggering ED thoughts, it actually made me eat healthier. And more. I wanted to get enough nourishment to build up my glycogen stores for the next day. I wanted to eat enough to have a good run (and not have cramps, aka banana) and then enough to replenish myself afterward. I got my favorite indulgence, Fairlife chocolate milk, and I had a glass after every run (chocolate milk is like, better than a sports drink for after a workout, no joke). I got excited to eat food I loved and witness that food turn into energy later in the day. I didn't want to restrict calories because I knew it'd make my next run hell. And all I wanted was to have a nice run.\n\nIt is so cool to be working on my cardio and fitness and also being inspired to eat more.

And whatever form your ED takes always be vigilant in case it tries to sneak back in. But I am grateful that for me, running came at the right time in my personal recovery and allowed me to change my relationship with body and food.

I even liked the soreness in days after. i couldn’t get enough. \n\nof course when i told my family i got into running it was a “oh sureee you did” but i did get into it and ive kept at it, as a notorious habit breaker. its been a constant ive had, something to look forward to and something to work at constantly. \n\nit gave me a lot of self confidence, and reminded me that i can do anything i really seek out. i’m capable, im not just some inside person who hates outside like i was at sixteen, i can change, grow, and learn new things. \n\nso i’d say overall it gave me a lot of confidence in myself, and a really fun hobby!",

Every morning before work I would run 1 mile. At first I'd feel like shit but overtime I started feeling like shit if I DIDN'T run.

When we run together, I make sure to let her set the pace so it's comfortable for us both. If I set the pace, we run into the exact same problems you're having.\n\nAs for listening recommendations, have you ever tried a comedy podcast? I won't make specific recommendations because so much of it comes down to taste, but I really like listening to something funny when I run.

That said, are you landing on your heels? This will cause pain everywhere between your feet and lower back. If so switch to landing on the balls of your feet. You’ll feel like you’re falling forward at first, and you’ll run faster, but it allows your knees to flex and the impact is absorbed through the muscles not through your joints. \n\nListening to something: This is up to you but my experience is if I run to music I end up timing my pace to the beat and that’s normally a disaster. Podcasts or audiobooks are better but ultimately I run for running and that allows me to use it like meditation. Allowing thinking to dominate ruins your run, and just like meditation if you let thoughts go you have a better experience. \n\nYour mind WILL throw up everything it is thinking such as … what to eat for dinner, work, relationship, something your mum said, TV, cutting your toenails, forgetting to text someone, the day the sun explodes, etc etc. Aim to let it all go. \n\nAlso, as someone else says consider running on your own.

It is physically and mentally demanding.\n\nIt’s so easy to just stop, but you haven’t! That’s a WIN! Try focusing on the “small” wins (having the self-discipline to get yourself out the door, consciously deciding to exercise instead of sitting around, courageously pursuing a challenging task and not shying away, etc.) Find your WHY. The reason you are running in the first place (maybe a goal you have, health reasons, etc.)\n\nI actually recommend NOT listening to music or audiobooks when running. If that is the only thing that will get you though runs, it won’t last (as you are starting to notice). One hack is to run with other people (friends, coworkers, local run club) and just talk throughout the run. Talk about anything and everything (just not about running). You’ll be amazed how quick the run goes by and it will keep your mind off of the run. The body will just take over while your mind is engaged in the conversation.\n\nI’d also recommend NOT running with your husband every run as others have mentioned.\n\nGood luck and remember to acknowledge your wins!",

Of course he works hard at running, trains hard, experiences pain, etc. this is not to discount his effort! \n\nThis is to point out that I am the absolute complete opposite. When I ran my first 10k, I was super fit at the time BEFORE I started training running. I trained for that 10k for 4 months, something my husband kept INSISTING I could do in more like 10 weeks, and was still dying by mile 3 when it came to race day. This was at an 11 minute/mile pace, so no, not a fast pace.\n\nSo what I mean here is that some of us just have an extremely hard time running, and progress slower than others. So for me? Running is absolutely something to endure. It is hard as shit. It’s honestly not very enjoyable right now, because at the moment I can barely run a mile at a 13 minute pace. \n\nBut how will I ever get to a point where running is enjoyable if I don’t push myself?? If I don’t spend time “enduring” the muscle fatigue and out of breath feeling?  I’m honestly surprised some of these other commenters have never felt the “overwhelming desire to quit” while running. To me that’s a super normal feeling, and in fact is part of why I run a little bit— to develop mental toughness. \n\nAgree with others though that physical pain in your joints definitely might point to overtraining, so please be careful with that. Glad to hear you’re in PT.\n\nNow to answer your initial question— I deal with negative self talk after runs as well, but not as much during runs. That sounds really tough, and I’m sorry you’re dealing with that. My go to option is pretty much always to choose my favorite music to run to. I have a playlist called “distractingly dance-y” where I put all the songs that I feel the overwhelming urge to dance to when I hear them. I have songs on there that never fail to make me smile. Another option is searching for like, girl power jams (not sure if you’re a woman, so this may not hit home). There’s nothing like lizzo singing about self love or Beyoncé singing about who run the world to get you feeling pumped up about yourself. \n\nI hope you find something that works. And, if you don’t? Don’t force it! There’s no need to do an activity that makes you miserable. It sounds like you have other exercise you enjoy, so lean on that and forget running if in the end you can’t find any joy in it.",

The super long finish chute for the 5k was very awkward, but I get it since the half finished there as well.

I'm not one to push through crows, which I guess is on me and I wasn't worried about my times, but there's probably a better way to make sure the faster 5k finishers are starting closer to their projected half pace.

You just mostly need to run consistently, do a long run every weekend and generally avoid doing stupid shit. Eat and sleep reasonably.\n\nAs to the quality of the generated plans, these are all hit or miss. If you happen, by sheer accident, to match with the plan -- you will get great results. If your physiology is not standard, your training zones do not match a standard formula, your maximum heart rate does not match standard formula, etc, your generated plan might be wrong and then you might see poor results because you are training at wrong intensities.\n\nMy Garmin can't seem to make up its mind about my maximum heart rate, my VO2max or my lactate threshold even though I do a variety of different types of runs, I run pretty much daily and I always use a Garmin chest strap. I know they are all wrong because I also regularly do a laboratory test and I see actual graphs and I can see with my eyes that Garmin numbers are all shit. All training generated based on those numbers is shit, too, as well as the race predictions which are extremely optimistic.\n\nI am happy Garmin coach works for you. If it works, I will not try to change your mind to use anything else.\n\nFor everybody else -- it is fine to check it. But if you don't see results, understand, it might not be your fault.",

It's difficult to explain what I mean specifically, but like - I don't get as cold OR as hot as easily; I don't get dizzy when bending over as easily; I don't get weak from being hungry as easily; I'm just a more resilient person. I feel that this applies mentally too, it's like HRT has given me a \"thick skin.\" Metaphorically, but also physically - my skin is actually tougher, does not get scratched as easily. My muscles have a \"hardness\" more than before.\n\nRunning, well, I've been running for over 25 years so there's a lot of ups and downs and it's too difficult to tease out the different factors, so I don't know that HRT has had a direct influence on my speed. But I'm training more for endurance than speed, and I don't have any one metric I can use to compare. To summarize, however, I've never been a fast athlete, so times aren't as important.

I honestly can't recommend it enough.\n\nThe other thing that really helped me was access to a treadmill (it was worth the gym fees for a few months!). Set it at your race pace and do your tempo runs on it. Come race day I felt totally dialed in, like my body knew exactly the pace I needed to go and just did it... it felt almost natural. \n\nRemind yourself on race day of all the hours you've put in, all the crappy weather you've run through, the hills you've done... whatever it is that's up ahead is no prob because you've seen it and done it before.

I’m sure it was hilarious to see me cross the finish line, looking exhausted, surrounded by a bunch of excited little kids still full of energy. \n\nAll of this to say…you’re not alone in your first marathon not going as planned. I’ve heard people say that going from a 5K to a 10K is just doubling the distance, but going from a half to a full is a totally different physical and mental game. And that’s why people recommend you don’t even worry about time for your first one - just experience it and learn something so you can strategize for the next one. \n\nMajor props to you, by the way, for a) finishing a marathon and b) wanting to do another one right away! My first marathon was in 2019, and while I’ve thought about doing another one here and there over the years, I only just signed up for my second to be done in 2024.",

You are racing in training, which builds fitness but also demands more recovery and can keep you from doing other training -- or just injure you.\n2. Run more volume.

Dropping runs and changing all the paces is not following any plan.\n3. Find a running group or a running buddy with whom you can do weekly long runs. Why? Because you get bored and need someone to distract you enough to stop from racing your long runs. If you can't do that then make a game of trying to hit a particular easy pace for each km of your run. Try to do it without looking at your watch and see how close you can get your pacing to your target. Do something/anything other than racing your long runs every week.\n4. Don't show up to the start of a marathon feeling STARVING! How was that ever going to work out well?\n\nYou have a lot of speed in your legs. You just need to pull back on the reins in training with lower intensity and higher volume more often. Train like a marathoner and you will run a better marathon. Trust in a proven plan.",

This is where it all comes together and it should be hard but it should also be rewarding. Each workout in this phase should give you a glimpse of race day.\n- Tapered too long and badly? Strength training should go into maintenance mode as you hit those peak weeks, with a bigger focus on plyometrics and explosiveness. Same with the running. Dropping more than 20% peak volume should only be done in the week of the race, and intensity maintained throughout.\n- Your nutrition needs work. NO WAY IN HELL should anyone line up at a marathon feeling remotely hungry. Something’s terribly off there. What it signals is that your glycogen stores were likely flat and you ran out of fuel / hit the wall. How well are you eating, generally? I found a massive change in just eating as much as often as I could through training but focusing on simple whole foods. Boiled potatoes and carrots by the kilo.\n- Marathon running *should* be mainly a muscular endurance challenge, less so an aerobic one. You’re running at somewhere around 75-80% of your aerobic capacity, after all. \n\nOn the plus side, if you get these things right I think you can shave 20-30minutes based just on your current actual fitness. Your 5k/10k results are very close to mine and my marathon time from October was 3:14.\n\nGood luck!",

From there, I ran my PB last Sunday at 3hrs28. I had trained really well this year but along my journey in the last 3 years, my marathon time has lingered around the same times with a big jump of this year. \n\nThe marathon race on the day is a build up of multiple factors that have to go your way.

Practice the timing and components of your pre-run food. Do the same thing in training that you are planning on doing for your race. The pre-race food is at least as important as the food you consume during the race. Test it, revise it, and test it again until you know exactly what works for you when you want to run fast and long.\n2. Pick a marathon training plan which incorporates marathon-paced mileage into your long efforts. Running 14-20 miles at easy pace is a very different challenge to doing 15 miles with at least half of them at marathon pace. Drill that marathon pace into your legs so that it feels more familiar on race day.\n\nGood luck with your future races. Your improvement will be really gratifying.",

It made me realize how underprepared I truly was as I crossed into the 18+ mile range.  That bridge into Crystal City was my nemesis.  I can feel your pain through your words!\n\nI’m assuming you have caught the bug considering you’re thinking about Philly, and possibly other marathons.  One thing that has helped me tremendously is finding a like-minded running group.  It keeps you honest, engaged, dedicated and you can make some friends along the way.  I’ve learned that consistency is key in marathon preparation.  Constantly logging those miles and increasing your long-run endurance is what it takes for strong performance, and chasing people along the way makes it easier.  \n\nIt also sounds like you were able to pull through till the end because of your military background, meaning that you’re experienced in pushing your body beyond its limits and understanding yourself.  That is a key attribute to have as a marathon runner.  Absolute key.  The other of course is preparedness.  Your weekly mileage was really low for marathon prep, it should be somewhere about twice of what you were doing so that your body becomes used to the load of putting up miles.  Everybody is different, but my training cycle usually consists of at least 3 20-mile training runs and logging 50+ miles per week for the latter half of my training cycle.  I liked that you started low and slowly built up over a long time.  I have seen way too many people spike in their mileage towards the end in a panic only to end up injured.  \n\nI am also running Philly this year.  Time to earn our bells!  Good luck 🤘",

I spent the year saying I wasn't really going to run it, but did most of the training because I was in a running group, but then managed to run a 4:32:10. I cramped up like a son of a bitch after mile 18, so the final stages of the run was fighting through pain and just sheer mental grit that I was going to finish even if I had to walk. \n\nThis year I started running Half Marathons as early as January, keeping my weekly long runs around 18-22km for the majority of the year, up to around 18-20 weeks ago when we pushed it step by step over 23km to 30-32km. \n\nMy big concern from races this year has always been heat and hydration. Last year at the first marathon it was 18-19 degrees in October, and I overheated, fuelled badly and fell into cramp city after 18 miles. Twice this year I've ran races where it got over 20 degrees and I've suffered from overheating again, slowing me down or bringing me to a complete stop, but thankfully no cramps. This week ahead of my race I'm drinking a lot, taking in more salts, I'm also carb loading with lots of pasta meals since Monday, so if something goes wrong this year its not going to be from a training or nutritional side. \n\nMoonshot is Sub 4 hr.

TBH I never ran seriously enough to be limited by the muscles in my legs but it used to happen to me cycling - they start to feel like mashed potatoes and don't develop power.\n\nJust because your lungs feel fine doesn't mean it's not a fitness issue.  Your muscles and vasculature in your legs need to also be good at exchanging oxygen and energy.  That takes some time to develop and then you're back to feeling like you could run harder if only you could breathe better.\n\nWhat else...  Yeah, lifting weights will give you DOMS when you start and sometimes when you change up your workouts or add weight.  It's also important to be clear what you're trying to achieve.  You're probably more than strong enough to run quite fast and running does more for your muscular endurance than weights will.  But they can sure help you avoid injury, especially if you need to balance and stabilize stuff coming in from odd directions.  Good conversation to have with a trainer.  I had a point...  DOMS usually goes away after you warm up.\n\nHow to keep going when I feel like crap - actually that's pretty hard.  I understand it's different for the half marathon but when I raced mountain bikes, we'd usually go for a bit under 90 minutes and tactics aren't really a thing - you just go at threshold pace until someone tells you you're done.  Ticking off things I don't need to do again helps.  Like, 11 out of 13 miles done or that's three climbs completed, I've done 60% of them.  Learning to pace for a legit max. effort is pretty hard though and I think most recreational runners won't really get the exposure, especially for distances like a half marathon.  You could go to some 5k's and 10k's at the right times in your plan though.",

You probably learned a lot of techniques in physical therapy. Keep those going along with running. Squats and lunges will work wonders for your knees. You also need to work your glutes way more than you expect. Hip flexibility is also super important. \n\nNever skip the warmup! Never ever skip the stretch!\n\nIt's okay to slow down. Listen to what your body is telling you and respond accordingly. If you aren't sure if pain is real or in your head, slow down for a few minutes. Walk if you have to. If pain persists, stop your run. Do strength training that day instead and don't skip the stretch afterwards!! \n\nConsistency is more important than volume or intensity. Pick a distance or time that you are comfortable with to establish a base and confidence. Build your strength and endurance from there. \n\nI'm cheering for you, friend!!

But if it’s just for fitness (mental health)…\n\nYou’re likely overtraining. Overtraining causes a cascading effect on other aspects of our lives: we feel tired constantly, our body is in a constant state of soreness/tiredness (never feeling fresh on a run), we begin to dread our next run… this will in turn cause your sleep cycle to become more interrupted, causing less quality of sleep (also causing your body to not recover/repair properly), which bleeds into your day to day life/relationships. In turn, your testosterone and dopamine will drop. And all this together will lead into a depressive state.\n\nAlso track that you’re eating enough on the run days. Lack of nutrition can cause fatigue and improper recovery.\n\nI would suggest taking a couple weeks off, see if your sleep quality returns, if your mood improves. Reset your body/training. This will also help you determine if something more is going on, if you need to see a health professional.\n\nWhen you do return to training, and if only training for general fitness/mental health, cap the length of one run per week to 60ish minutes. The rest anywhere to 30-45 minutes. Run 3-4 runs per week: 2 easy, 1 fast(er) run, and 1 long run (60 minutes). See if this helps improve things for you.\n\nYou can also cross train: swim, bike, elliptical, row, weightlifting… as another person said, running might not be your thing - and that’s ok!\n\nBest of luck to you!",

You need to soak them overnight before cooking them, but they're great with rice. Adding in a star anise and a bayleaf whilst cooking will really help with the flavour as well. They're really flexible in what you can do with them; they go great in salads, wraps, chilli, rice and beans. \n\nSimilarly, other beans/pulses. Lentils and chickpeas are fantastic for the nutrition/budget. \n\nIf your cooking facilities are limited, then see if you can score an Instant Pot from Goodwill, Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, or whatever works for you locally. It's a solid investment that will save you money in the long run. A pack of chicken legs and some veggies will make you a pot of soup that will last for days - it just takes some planning. \n\nIn the longer term,(if you really get into running), you can save loads of money by making your own isotonic/sports drinks (fruit squash, sugar, salt, basically) and even fuelling gels. \n\nThe one thing you need to consider is proper footwear. To begin with, the cheapest (under 15 bucks) running shoes from Decathlon (if you have a branch near you) will almost certainly do you fine, but if you end up running longer distances you'll probably want something more serious. That's probably going to be where most of your running expense goes. A pair of running shoes will typically last about 500 miles. You can often pick up bargains on last years models (depending on where you live). \n\nApart from that, you might want to invest in (again - cheap from Decathlon, or Lidl (or equivalent)) a couple of sports T-shirts. Cotton tends to get very heavy because it holds onto sweat, whereas a \"technical\" running shirt wicks it away so it can evaporate. Also (if you're female) a well fitting sports bra or two is apparently a good idea to purchase. \n\nRunning can be somewhat expensive, but it can also be incredibly cheap! \n\nHope this helps, and good luck!",

Maybe look into some personal safety stuff like pepper spray or one of those little alarm things you can clip on your clothes.\n\nAs for not being able to run long. Don’t worry. I would start with a run walk beginner program. Everyone starts somewhere, and running out of breath after a few minutes is super common for beginners. The trick is to start slow. Like, really slow. Slower than you think you need to. Mix walking and jogging, and gradually increase how long you jog for. There’s this program called Couch to 5K that’s great for easing into it.\n\nFinding running buddies can be tough, but it’s worth a shot to look for local running groups on Facebook or Meetup. Even if you don’t click with everyone, you might find one or two people who are down to run together.\n\nAnyway, good luck with everything!

                    "body": "At 55yo I started my running journey just over a year ago.  I actually started walking and transitioned into running when walking could not keep my heart rate high enough.  When I started running, I was quite confused with what I should be doing.  It was trial and error with various sports watches that ended up really setting me on a path to better understanding of what the heck I was doing.  I had a Garmin Venu 3 watch and used the app to setup a 5k training program.  I didn't really understand the running language and I had a lot to learn.  Your questions all similar to ones I had at various points in my journey.  A year in and I have run a 5k and a 10k and am gunning for a sub-30 5k.\n\nRecently I decided to create a blog to track my latest goal (the sub-30 5k) and ended up starting on a primer for new runners.  It is a series that I am a couple posts into now.  It may have information useful to you.  Feel free to check it out (I think you can get the website in my bio).\n\nAs for a more direct response to your question:\n\n\\* The number of days you run is largely dependent on how many days you can dedicate to running.  If you can run every day, the there isn't anything that stops one from doing so and many runners run daily.  I would suggest 3 or 4 days, with a short recovery run, 1 or 2 run days for speed and tempo work and a slow long run.\n\n\\* Rest days are pretty personal and really comes down to how you feel.  Listen to your body.  It will tell you.\n\n\\* Stretching is one of those topics that you will get passionate opinions on.  Some say static stretching (what you'd imagine stretching to be if someone told you to stretch) is essential and other say dynamic stretching (stretching that is incorporated with movement) is far better.  Personally I never static stretch and only dynamic stretch if I am feeling particularly tight or sore, otherwise I simply use a 1 mile warmup walk/jog to get my body ready to run.\n\n\\* Improving times and distance are accomplished by different types of training.  Basically strides are going to train your body to move faster and long runs are going to train your body for endurance.  That is a very simplified answer though.\n\n\\* No protein shakes are not required after runs.  It is far better to hydrate and maintain electrolytes.  Your muscle recovery question really depends on just how aggressive you are going to be at running.  If you are someone who will be training 5-7 days a week and doing half or full marathons then your question might require more focus.  As a 5k distance runner training 3 days a week, you shouldn't really be taxing your muscles enough to stress on that aspect.  Again listen to your body though.  In general though, a massage or roller work or hot tub/bath soak will suffice.",

It can be frustrating when your body doesn’t respond the way you remember it could.\n\nBut here’s the thing: that 12:30 mile? It’s a starting point. We all have to begin somewhere after time off. Try not to fixate on your old times or compare yourself to who you were at 22. You’re on a different path now.\n\nWhat works for most is focusing on consistency rather than speed or distance. Set a goal to run 3 times a week, no matter how short or slow. Some days will be better than others, but showing up is the win.\n\nThe “easy” feeling does come back, but it takes time. For most, it’s about 6-8 weeks before starting to feel in the groove again. Your body needs time to adapt.\n\nDon’t get discouraged if you’re not feeling great after runs right now. That’ll change as your body gets used to the impact again. Make sure you’re giving yourself enough recovery time between runs too.\n\nStick with it. The progress might feel slow, but it’ll come.

You can build in more actual rest days, sticking to a 3 or 4 day a week run plan.  OR you can do a 5 to 6 day a week run plan (or even a continuous streak) - but reduce the amount you're working out per day.\n\nI would also offer that for overall less physical stress and risk of injury, you focus on improving your cardio fitness first.  Tailor your training plan on that, then switch to distance training for your future marathon success.   There's nothing wrong with going slow.  However, longer sessions repeatedly over time increase the wear and tear on your body and require more recovery time or result in a significant increase in risk of injury.  Injury prevents training and results in failed or delayed goals.\n\nTrust me, I understand the urge.  I WANT to focus on my favorite half marathon distance, but coming off of covid, I know I have to focus on getting my mile time back up before I start that training or I'm going to fail.\n\nGood luck to you my friend!",

There is no reason you have to loose weight to run a marathon. \n\nWhat you need is a good training plan and something that helps motivate you through the boring middle of it. A training calendar you can cross off, rewards for doing certain sessions, etc whatever it is that can motive you do it. I personally like giving myself star stickers for completing workouts. Yes I'm an adult, but it works! Oh and don't treat what your garmin says as gospel. It's not tuned to your body yet. The more you use it the more it will reflect the reality of your training. After years mine still thinks I could run a 2 hour half (my PR is 2:45).\n\nNow if you also want to loose weight separate from your running goals, a few observations. 1) you are doing a ton of cardio. The body can easily adjust to cardio and get more efficient at doing the same routine over and over again. You need to switch it up. Weight training would be a boon for you. Find a personal trainer who understands the importance of running in your life or grab a book you can work from. The new rules of lifting series has been helpful for me. \n2) to really loose the kind of weight you're wanting, you should work with a nutritionist to get your diet on point. Food is complicated, our relationship with food is extra complicated. A nutritionist can help you figure out exactly what you need and trouble shoot specific challenges you run into.",

And when you think you’re running slowly, slow down even more. And maybe go slower than that.

Then two minutes later we’re struggling to catch our breath and hating life, wishing the run was over. Don’t do that. Slow down. \n\nIn my experience, it takes quite a while before running starts to “feel good.” Like most things in life, when we’re doing something we’ve never really practiced before, it’s hard. Runner’s high is real, but it takes getting past the struggling-out-of-breath part. This is where pacing comes back in. If your breathing is so labored that you wouldn’t be able to hold a conversation while you’re running, you’re going too fast. Slow down. \n\nOnce your body can get to that place where it doesn’t have to work so hard just to function while running, it gets more enjoyable. Depending on your current fitness level, that could take 6-12 weeks to get to that point. That’s ok. No one learns how to read or cook or master a trade in a week or two weeks or a month.

I offer the thought that it's okay to absolutely loathe running - while you are doing it.  And that's because you probably will for the first block, first mile, etc.  That's absolutely normal.  It happens to me every run.   AFTER I get past a certain point (depends on the day) then I like running.  And after I finish I am absolutely in love with running ... until the first part of my next run when I absolutely loathe running again.\n\nIt's a brain game.   It's your body telling your brain that you shouldn't do this, the body preferring to stay at rest and detecting no threat that would require it to do this crazy running thing.   The urge to stop can be quite strong.  However, once your brain convinces your body that you are not stopping and that you are going to finish the quarter mile/half mile/whatever distance ... then your body kind of gives in.  Then it starts to relax and endorphins kick in and you start feeling pretty darn proud of yourself.\n\nThat first part though - esp. when you're a beginner - it's rough.  You feel awkward and worried about doing things right, and it can come as a shock when your body starts sending all this urges to quit on top of that. \n\nJust remember - unless it's actual physical pain - do not stop before your planned distance.  You can do this.  You will feeel better when you are done. It just may not seem like it at first.",

This maximizes your bang-for-the-buck with every minute spent running.

You set out for an easy run, someone passes you, and then it's game on, \"*fuck that piece of shit, I'm going to pass them and show them how its done*\". Training smart means knowing when to chill out and let the ego sleep. \"Good for them, I'll probably pass them soon, today is an easy run day\". \n\nPhysiologically: Zone 2 targets your slow-twitch muscle fibers, aerobic - fat and oxygen. High-intensity work stresses your fast-twitch fibers, which burn sugar and create more fatigue - anaerobic. Both systems matter. But they do different jobs. They support each other. With a strong aerobic base, you can sustain anaerobic efforts longer and they feel less uncomfortable. \n\nI have the easiest time doing z2 runs when I run with someone who is less fit than me (my wife).

Outside of accidents, injuries come from attempting to do too much too soon. Overtraining, lack of appropriate strength and conditioning, or pushing your body to attempt distances that you haven't worked up to gradually. Soreness is inevitable, but injuries aren't  \n  \nIs running healthy? Yes, if you train sensibly. Running, and cario in general is a massive influencing factor in reducing a whole host of comorbidities. Essentially, people with good cardio fitness (i.e. good heart health) are generally statistically less likely to develop things like heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, strokes etc. Also the idea that running is bad for your knees is outdated and has been consistently debunked. Compared to other cardio activities, it's not like running is better or worse than anything else. But it is more accessible, less costly, and the mental aspect is pretty good too.  \n  \nCan you go from coach to marathon in 6 months? Yes, if you don't mind having the worst time imaginable and hobbling over the line in 6 hours after spending 5 of those hours regretting everything. A standard marathon training plan is about 16 weeks. Call it 4 months. However, this assumes an already good level of fitness and an already good base level of weekly mileage of around 20 miles per week (meaning that you can comfortably and consistently cover 20 mile for several weeks, no big deal, and not feel overly fatigued).\n\nTo get to that point is gonna take time. More than you think. And rushing it, well that is likely to land you in injury territory. \n\nDoes this mean you should give up the idea of running a marathon? Not at all. But, give yourself longer. Since you haven't run as an adult, you don't even know if you like the reality of training. Personally, I'd tackle a smaller distance first. Sign up for a 10km race or something. Commit to a well structured training plan, and see how you find it. Then, if all goes well, sign up for a half marathon and see how you find that jump in the training intensity. Then, if that goes well, consider the marathon, in the understanding that the training demands will be even greater.\n\nI don't say any of this to put you off, but you only get one first marathon and you'll remember it forever. Do you really want the memory of your first marathon to be one of pain and struggle and injury and 'why did I do this?' because you rushed into it?",

I think it is possible, but will be difficult and require a lot of work on your end. You mention injuries a lot and going from nothing to marathon in 6 months will probably greatly increase your risk of injury. Not impossible, but maybe a half marathon in 5-6 months and a marathon in 8-12 is a more conservative timeline.\n\nAs for injuries: If you train healthily and listen to your body they are less likely to happen. I feel that I am fairly conservative in my training effort but occasionally get a niggle in my ankles or achilles. Now while that may be an \"injury\" I let it heal up for a week or two while doing other activities, and I am back to running. \n\nAs for other activities, there are trade offs to everything. You mention cycling and while you may get your heart in shape, the non-weight bearing aspect of cycling can become a problem with bone density as you get older. If you go outdoor cycling, it is known for collarbone breaks too, so it is not without risk. \n\nWhile this may be controversial in a running sub, I find triathlon with resistance training to be a good mix of everything and be closer to the ideal training for me. You get a good mix of weight and non-weight bearing exercise to keep the heart healthy. And resistance training to keep the body resilient (which becomes hugely important as you get older).\n\nA lot of people will preach the \"your knees will turn to dust\" while not doing any exercise at all.

Don't increase mileage too fast, just a little at a time. I think they say 10% a week increase (or less). They also say 80% of your weekly mileage should be at a pace you can have a conversation (I'm trying to get better at this, as I naturally run faster than this but it's been shown not to build stamina as well).\n\n3. Shouldn't need to fuel during a 5k. Just do what you normally do, don't try anything new in terms of food or drink within a few days of the race. Actually don't do ANYTHING new on race day. No new clothes, shoes, hairstyles etc.\n\n4. Hydrate and get good sleep the night before.\n\n5. If you track your pace, do 3.1 miles in the week leading up to the race and pay attention to your speed. Stay at that speed on race day no matter how much the race day endorphins try to trick you into sprinting out the gate.\n\n6. Pay attention to the weather in your runs leading up to race day and on race day itself so you know how many clothes you need to wear to be comfortable. This is invaluable to avoid being freezing or carrying extra layers.\n\n7. Enjoy! Race day is like a group celebration of a very individual sport. I always feel like I have runner friends on race day 😂.\n\n8. I jot down some notes about the race on the back of my bib (after), like what I liked about it and/or if anyone came to support me. I feel like it will be nice to look back on when all the bibs blur together and I forget which was which.\n\nEnjoy and have fun!",

Can run for an hour straight without any issues and my longest is 5 miles.  Working towards a half marathon.  \n\nLessons learned along the way\n\n1.  Slow is fast.  You really can’t run too slow.  Speed will come over time.  Build your muscles and cardio base.  I’m still very slow but I can run a lot longer.  \n\n2. Consistency is key.  I started at 3 days a week that was not negotiable.  I think I missed a week at most because of a wicked sickness.  If I had a minor head cold, I would run. \n\n3. When you finish couch to 5k, get on another structured plan.  I use Runna…there is a lot of science that goes into running.  If you do it right, you will not get injured or feel like you are dying.  You will still have hard workouts though…it’s part of the process.  I tried running about 7-8 years ago and finished the couch to 5k program and figured I would just run a little faster every week.  I ended up injuring myself multiple times.  \n\n4. Do not neglect proper cooldown.  Stretch your major leg muscle groups after every run.  If your muscles remain tight the next day, stretch them throughout the day.\n\n5.  Do not neglect full body workouts.  I like Runna because it offers running based workouts (upper body and lower body strength, Pilates, and Yoga). I do something every day and I run 4x a week now.  (added an extra run day at the end of last year).  Yoga and Pilates are like rest days for me.  Add stuff slowly…when I started I had 3 run days and two very light full body days.  \n\nBest advice out of all of this is start with the couch to 5k program and run SLOW.",

It was an absolute challenge but I did this for a month and by the end of the month I was able to jog, then slowly every couple weeks I would challenge myself to go just a little farther and built distance. \nI know it can sound unmotivating to build your base so slowly but truly, it's the way to go. So don't focus on your times or speed at first. Just enjoy the personal time your taking for yourself. Make yourself a good playlist to listen to or audiobook and just enjoy. You will get to the running point but it takes consistently showing up for yourself. \nDon't try to push yourself too hard too fast, you will get injured. I learned this the hard way.

                    "body": "I am a 29-year-old obese man. Throughout my life, I have always tried to run without getting informed first, and I always failed. Previously, I would just grab the first pair of sneakers I found, go to the seafront, and start running until I couldn't anymore. That was a huge mistake. Lately, I've started doing things properly; I bought the right shoes, both in terms of cushioning, given my weight of 125 kg and height of 193 cm, and for the support of my foot since I found out I am an overpronator. I've been alternating fast walking with running, gradually adding more running minutes, and things are really going well. It's tough, my legs hurt, and the effort is noticeable, but this way, it's sustainable, and above all, I can see progress week by week. I started with 1 minute of slow running and 2 minutes of walking for a total of 30 minutes. I thought it was really impossible to manage 2 consecutive minutes of running. But now I run for 5 minutes straight with 1 minute of walking for 10 rounds! If you do things the right way, it is achievable!\n\nHere's a list of things I think you should do to start running properly:\n\n1. **BUY THE RIGHT SHOES:** Go to a specialized running shoe store, get your gait analyzed, and get advice on the right shoes for your weight and foot support. Since I've had the right shoes, I've had ZERO knee problems or pain despite my weight.\n2. **PLAN YOUR TRAIN:** Use a running program. Initially, your legs and breath may not be enough to run throughout the workout. This can cause frustration, discouragement, and might make you quit running. Find a beginner's training schedule that alternates fast walking with running and gradually increases the running time. You will see that you'll make progress very quickly; I am still amazed at mine.\n3. **RUN SLOWLY**. This is the most important thing I've learned in these few weeks since I started running. At first, I thought 7:30 min/km was slow, but my heart rate would rise too much. Now, I run at 8:50 min/km or even 9 min/km, which might seem ridiculously slow, like walking speed, but it's not. The key is this! You need to run very slowly, even if it feels like you are running in place.\n4. **STAY IN ZONE 2:** Use a heart rate monitor. Initially, a normal wristwatch is fine, but if you have an Apple Watch from series 6 onwards (the most accurate on the market), it is more than sufficient. Try to spend as much time as possible in Zone 2 (60-70% of your maximum heart rate, which most watches automatically calculate with not perfect but sufficient accuracy for this initial phase). The slow running I mentioned before should keep you within this heart rate zone, ZONE 2. Over time, you will learn to listen to your body and understand when you are in Zone 2 because it's the zone that allows you to maintain a normal conversation while running. So, you will look at your watch less and less. Hence, I reiterate the previous point, RUN SLOW.\n5. **RESILICENE**: Your legs will hurt; it's normal. Try to train your mind to ignore that pain; it's just your body changing and adapting to a new form. A body capable of running!\n6. **GOOD LUCK!**",

Even on days you don't want to run : at least walk to get the habit going.\n\nOnce you start to like running or when you feel like the habit is starting to stick, here's what I'd recommend my younger self. Most of your runs should be at a pace that feel easy for you and not taxing too much on your heart. For example, to start, it could be 200m at an easy pace and then 2 minutes walking before doing it again. \nBut to really improve in endurance and stamina, I'd advise one run to me purposefully slower than your usual pace with a goal of running a little bit more than you usually do. \n\nFor example, if you usually don't run more than 200 meters at a time before needing to walk, then plan your weekly sloooow run to be at least 250-300 meters. I say sloooow because it's not natural. It's hard. Because you need to force yourself to go slower than you want to be. But that's how you'll get better.",

Because I feel like we have to cover a lot of ground here and I want you to be successful in your goals:\n\n* You need to **rest** \\-- like you said - you were not ready for that half.  You punished your body. Now, you need is rest and recovery.  Which means you need time.  You are 19, so I am hoping your recovery goes quickly; however, you cannot rush it.\n* Time will address your injuries -- dead toe nail might stay on, might fall off. Give it time. Blisters will heal.  Give it time. Knee pain should subside.  Give it time.  Doing stretches and working on flexibility isn't a bad thing, but general idea right now is to NOT stress it any more than you already have.\n* Once you are healed - look at training plans.   Most say you should already be running 3-4 times a week, and can run non-stop for 30 minutes minimum.   So if you do not think you are there yet, look at 5k or 10k training plans first before the HM plans.  Typically, the training plans will have you running \\~5 days a week, with the mileage increasing with each training week.  Whether that is Hal Hidgon, Marathon Rookie, Nike Run Club, Garmin, etc.  you just find the one that works best for you (I have used HH plans the most - he has 2 plans - Novice 1 and Novice 2 which I think would be a good starting point).  I'd recommend searching this sub as well as the r/running sub, which I believe has a pinned thread about running plans.\n   * Look at your shoes -- the toe nail and blisters (and knee pain to a certain degree) seem to indicate the shoes you were were NOT ideal for your running form/style.  I would look at going to a running store, getting fitted, and get shoes that work for you.  Yes, there will be a cost, but you will use those more than any other piece of equipment.  (Going to a running specific store will also allow you to try on a wider array of shoe brands and models vs. the big box stores).\n* Lastly and most importantly:  **you will recover when you recover.**  No one can gauge how much or little damage you've done to yourself.  Being that you are young, I would expect it limited and for you to recover faster than if you had done it at 30yo; however, no guarantees.\n\nI appreciate and applaud you getting bit by the running bug; but right now -- you can research, you can read up, and you can ready yourself.  I do not want you to push yourself and do stuff sooner than you should because that could lead to prolonged injuries or issues that follow you for a lot longer than a few weeks.\n\nWishing you the best in recover and your running.",

Develop a Mindfulness Meditation practice. More than anything, you can crush boredom by learning to be fascinated for being fully present. After developing a regular Mindfulness Meditation practice, any moment has the potential to be infused with importance. \n\n\nI'd personally recommend listening to the audiobook version of Meditation For Fidgety Skeptics by Dan Harris. The written book is good, too, but the audiobook contains many guided meditations.\n\n\n2. Related to #1, but Become a Tourist of Your Environment. Even if the route is the same, you never run through the same space twice. Take in the sights, sensations on your skin, the sounds, and how this make you feel. Choose to be fully present and use your running as a victory lap for being alive. You're doing someone truly amazing with every run --- celebrate it in every run.\n\n\n3. Investigate Your Bored Mind. When you're bored, consider why you're bored. Sit in that feeling. Maybe journal about it. See where it goes. ",

Push yourself to where you start gassing out and wobble and then go to active recovery slow mode, until you feel ready again and go for it. Get your heart up to 170-180bpm. The first time you do it you’ll probably get 2-3 mins max. Then each time on the same run you’ll manage less time at max. Obviously don’t over do it and stay mindful of injury and not pushing it too hard. But making a run challenging (for some personalities) makes it more interesting.

It's because you are in the crowd and lot of people who come at these events are not regular runners, so they start out fast and then start walking after a kilometre or two. And you feel like starting fast too. Rookie mistake. Start slow and then pick up pace gradually.\n\nRegarding rest before race day- I think 4/5 hours should be fine. Good if you can get 7-8 hours but the issue is it's hard to sleep in the night before race day because of anticipation and excitement. Happens during first few races.",

Have you run any races before? Race atmosphere is different than running one on your own. The excitement can definitely help people run faster and if you’re competitive it can help to have others running so you can try to catch them and pass them, but it can also cause people to start faster than they intend and fizzle out toward the end of the race sometimes missing their goal times. \n\nCan you give more insight on what your training looks like? Like how many days a week do you run, and how far do you run? What is the effort level of your runs- do they feel hard, moderate or easy? Do you do any long runs or speed work? Strength training? Cross training? This information would help a lot in giving you a bit more personalized advice.\n\nWorking on speed and endurance isn’t something you can force in just over a week’s time. Fitness takes time to build. Generally it takes at the very least a few weeks to start seeing improvements from adding in speed work so that is something to keep in mind for goal setting, expectations and timelines, just to help from getting discouraged if something seems to be taking longer than you expected it to.",

Mentally I thought, hey I think I can push myself, so on some days I would run 10-12 km thinking, wow, I'm super! I can do this! Even to the detriment of my running form I just wanted to hit those km numbers. \n\nTwo months later, while I was gearing up for a run, I took one step and felt a sharp pain in my knee. I tried to run it off and I simply made it worse. Running / doing squats really hurt, and it really didn't get better for nearly six months or so, but even after the pain was gone I told myself I was done with running. \n\nI just recently got back into running and have been EXTREMELY cautious and disciplined with my time and distance. I learned to listen to my body, stretch a lot more before and after running, take my weight training and physical therapy with my lower body more seriously, and err more on the side of preserving my body and energy for another day if I just feel like I'm not good to go physically, even if my mind is telling me to GO GO GO.",

He says that you have to get to a certain level of fitness before you can train, much like you've explained in your first point. His recommendation is to walk and hike to get some basic central cardiovascular fitness before incorporating short runs (like 100m at a time) during your walks, and then progressing to running at a really easy pace eventually. Really easy meaning not to a level that your lungs and legs feel like they're burning.\n\nI was lucky enough to have a friend mention easy running pretty early on. I did the classic beginner blunder of trying to run a new personal best on every single run, and only doing a 2 mile loop around the neighborhood. That works for a little bit (and has a high injury risk) but causes burnout and plateau very quickly. Once I slowed down I started actually *enjoying* my runs instead of having a \"no pain no gain\" painful workout. That was a game changer because it made me look forward to running every day.",

I began with a very simple run/walk plan that was so easy, I couldn’t possibly fail. This let me achieve minor victories and feel accomplished when finishing a run rather than setting the bar too high and falling short. I did this for 2 weeks, 8 runs in total before switching to full time running. It may take you longer and that’s okay! I ran a 5k this morning and while my pace was slow compared to my prime, I still feel good about myself and proud I did it. \n\nOne other bit of advice, no one is paying attention to you and your pace. If they happen to notice, they will forget by the time they finish their own run. I ran on a very busy trail in a major US city this morning and must have seen 100 people or more. I couldn’t pick a single one of them out of a lineup right now if my life depended on it. \n\nTry to remember what you loved about running and keep those things in mind when it feels too hard to go on.

But just the mere fact that you WANT to change that is a huge part of the battle, so I can only encourage you to turn that in to action.\nRemember, the first run; hell, the first five runs, will most likely suck. That’s so, so normal. Give it a chance. Your body is very good at adapting if your are just consistent. It adapts just as well to healthy habits as unhealthy ones.

Every single day you run, you’re doing more than about 95% of the planet; who aren’t running that day.\nPersonally, as a recent convert to running, I can tell you two things about how you ‘look’ when you run. First: You are barely noticed by other runners, we are all so concerned with our own form, or pace; or thoughts, during a run to worry much about what anyone else looks like or the pace they are doing. Having said that, secondly: I am always far more impressed and proud of the ‘bigger’ people that run past me than the super-slim super-fits. Because I know what an effort they are putting in and what it personally took for them to take that first step; and then another; and then another…you go girl, your body was literally made to run.

Even after I was not a beginner, and I was running 10ks multiple times a week. It never, ever, ever got easier, even after months, with proper training plan where I do some speed runs, some light runs, some distance runs etc it was just a constant sturggle those first 5km, and if my run was ONLY an \"easy\" 5km? It was never fucking easy\n\nWhat I found is that I need something to REALLY warm up my body. I like to do spin at the gym and go for my run immediately after. Like, I go to spin class for 30-45 min, sweat my ass off, kill my glute and quad muscles, everything is so warmed up and fired and yes I'm dead and tired by the end of it\n\nBut the walk off the bike, and out of the gym is just enough to recover enough to just start the run. Then once I begin I feel so fucking good. I am light, I am loose, I am literaly weightless. I can breathe. I feel good. For once. I know it's not feasible for everyone but if you have a gym membership, do 30 min of spin beforehand. Good hard spin. lawd it works\n\nBut yeah I really think the key is to have something that warms you up, phsyically, and also which engages your muscles. The feeling I feel after a spin class is that my muscles are like.. craving stimulation lol. I wont use adult wording but they need to be stimulated, and running scratches that itch. And because I am so warmed up and engaged, it just feels easy. The feeling after 6km in my run where I feel weightless and I can just keep running forever, I get instantly because of that 30 min spin beforehand\n\nAnd yeah, I could just run for those 30 min to warmup instead and suffer it. But that's the point. I don't want to suffer. Spin is challenging, but it's never *hard*. When I do spin, I feel good and in the moment right form the beginning. No tight muscles or pains or difficulty breathin I need to get used to. It's just, tough in the beginning, and tough in the end. And I like that",

But i continued to run harder each run and eventually i had to give up for the season as the pain became too much. Started next year but the same thing happened again so went to a lot of physiotherapy sessions which helped. Also, started doing a lot of stretching next year as well. I think you need to take a step back and if you have already decided on a race then maybe try to push it. Reduce your pace and do at least 10 mins of stretching before and after every run. Shin raises/ standing wall knee raises and 1 step knee/shin stretch on the stairs are my go to exercises. This is my 3rd year but i still my right leg starts to pain once my weekly mileage increases or my speed increases but the pain is much manageable now. Also, buy a roller and try to use it everyday over shins, calf muscles. I was also told that shin splints can also happen when 1 leg is weaker than the other one so tries to over-compensate by overdoing it. This can happen when your knees/glutes/calf muscles are not strong, so try to incorporate weight training for your legs also.\nAlso, as a new runner we try to do too much too soon. I wanted my 5k time to come down each run. I wanted my average time to come lower with each run but now i think it was a mistake. Running is a long term game and it is not advisable to go too fast too soon. What i achieved in a month should have been  ideally done in 3-4 months.",

This means, on average, I'd say keep it below 165, preferably in the 150s. This might mean slowing as slow as you can go, or walking. It's all perfectly normal during base build, and especially when going from couch to 5K. Still it is good to know what distances you are capable of, at the end of the day, but don't make that HR an everyday thing, as you become susceptible to injury/ overuse (takes longer for some to recover from high intensity workouts), and miss out on building up the aerobic base, in favor of staying anaerobic adapted. I used to run like this every day and I have 4 different types of overuse that haunt me today. They got chronic, which can be permanent. I used to think pain was gain and would set out with an ideal pace in mind and just stick it in for as long as I could, until I could run 7:30 minute mile 10Ks but always in the red (high HR). My wife on the other hand did a low HR based training regiment and when I'd run with her I couldn't even run 13 minute miles at under 157BPM like she could. She had a hell of an aerobic base. Yet I had a heck of an anerobic base and could sustain high pace at extremely high HR's, even going into the 200s on occasion. I also, at one point, started to get a belly on me, from too much carbs and too high a pace, but had really skinny legs/ arms and this was because I was skipping the fat burn zone, in favor of always on carb burn mode, which is what high intensity mostly is.

Does it matter if you can do the exercise if you can't recover from an injury or inflammatory response from your body. The older I get the more I focus on dealing with recovery rather than the workout. \n\nI'll give you some useful tools that have worked for me.\n\nInfrared sauna and red light therapy: both of these have helped a lot with chronic pain especially in the neck, back area, wrists, and feet. Especially in your case this could be something that could drastically benefit you. I noticed that once I started using it In less than a week I noticed massive difference. First I started going to the gym using their infrared sauna. And then later went on Amazon and bought myself and infrared sauna. It's definitely worth it especially if The pain is constant everyday. The red light therapy device i got from redlightman online. if you do plan on using the redlight use some kind of cbd topical with it. Helps ALOTTTT MORE with healing!!! The red light helps the CBD penetrate deeper with the vasodilation and absorption. Can't recommend it enough.\n\nRedlight device from: (Redlightman)\n\nGinger extract with bromelain: both of these compounds have a systemic effect on lowering inflammation and is very similar to curcumin which is the main compound found in turmeric. I noticed that my baseline pain is a lot lower now ever since I started supplementing both. I like the brand nutricost and bulk supplements which you can find on Amazon. They have great products\n\nCBD topical and CBD tincture: I noticed that ever since I started using CBD topically and some CBD internally that this has done a drastic shift and helping me deal with pain. I take a CBD pain relief gel topical on my areas of inflammation and pain. And then I take a CBD tincture internally and this helps with systemic inflammation. This combination is truly remarkable. If you do go for the CBD pain relief gel get either the 3000mg or 5,000 mg it's definitely worth it and it lasts you over 3 months. I would say this for sure is my top three go to's for when I'm in pain. Which is almost always lol\n\ngive CBN+CBD a try: CBN is one of the best cannabinoids that I have found for insomnia and anxiety. CBN is the most sedating cannabinoid and helps dramatically with insomnia disorders. I have found that CBN is more potent than CBD when it comes to anxiety relief. CBN has heavy relaxing effects on the muscles and nervous system so you feel literally the tension melt away. CBD is great still no doubt about it but CBN is definitely going to give more relief in my experience. I take a CBN+CBD deep sleep gummy the same company (herbal garden essentials) which also has L-theanine and melatonin. All of these compounds mixed together in the gummy gives me incredible anxiety relief and I sleep amazing. I noticed ever since I started using the CBN+CBD that my anxiety the next day is absolutely at its lowest. It really allows my body to sink in deep relaxation which allows the nervous system to recover so it feels fresh to encounter the daily stresses of life the next day.\n\nHighly recommend this combination. The muscle CBD pain relief Gel is from Herbal Garden Essentials . And the CBD tincture I get from Charlotte's Web. I like Charlotte's Web a lot just because they pretty much started the whole CBD movement in Colorado.\n\nDefinitely look into the sauna and CBD topical/ Tincture Those two have been a miracle for me. helping take care of the inflammation with the cbd daily can help with healing and recovering.\n\nHope this helps and gives you some kind of direction",

If a streak works for you, cool, everyone’s brains are different! But for me, it helped knowing I was aiming for 3/4 days a week, and so if I didn’t feel good or was worn out/bad mental health one day, I didn’t mentally feel set back or like I had failed, when I had days I didn’t run, or switched a planned day around. \n\n-I used the c25k app and just the act of feeling like I was following a structured plan, that I didn’t have to think about adjusting forward myself, and could visually see checked off progress was really helpful! I liked that it would slowly increase the challenge, so I didn’t feel bored doing the same thing over again, and it made me worry a little less about injury and trying to do too much too fast. Constantly a new goal to work towards! If you are already able to run a mile straight that particular program might start too easy for you, but having a structured plan to work with might help get closer to the 5k if that’s your goal beyond just running a faster mile. I went from thinking running 90 seconds was going to kill me this summer to now running 2 miles or so at a stretch and am working towards getting a full 5k in! \n\nStretching! I tried running before and burned out with sore knees and foot issues that kept cropping up. Making sure to look up a variety of stretches and treating it just as importantly as the run, has seemed to make a difference this time around in feeling better! \n\nKeep with it, whatever you decide to do! Find something inside that motivates you because every day you show up, means something! There will be off days and bad runs and crappy weather and setbacks, but keeping on showing up and making that one more step matters! ❤️ best of luck to you!

Turned thirty in February, never purposely ran a day in my life and decided to randomly pick it up these past couple months. \n\nFirst I would say go slower than what you feel like slow is. It’s best if you have some sort of tracker so you can keep an eye on things to improve or tone down. I’ve been slowly but surely improving my zone 2 training. In the beginning I would spike so quickly, but gradually you will build an endurance and aerobic base that will allow you to push for longer down the line. \n\nShoes! I’m just on my first set (Hoka Mach 6). This should be first but I think they both need the same amount of focus. The Hokas are treating me right so far. As I run with them, I know now that they’re not the perfect shoe. But it’s better than nothing. I think it’s hard to tell in store how a shoe will break in over runs. But go to a running store and get properly screened/fitted for a pair and try different pairs. \n\nStrength! I have dabbled in all sorts of training in my life. Cutting, bulking. But I was off of training for a while when I decided to get into running and had no stability or support, leading to an early injury. Don’t push yourself in a run if you feel uncomfortable beyond normal soreness from working out. \n\nApps and an Apple Watch have been a good support. The watch made me into a data freak but also keeps me in check. Running it with the health and fitness apps helps keep track of progress and just motivates me for some reason. I’ve been seeing a lot about the app Runna recently and decided to give it a try. I’ve been loving it so far. It has a similar couch to 5k kinda program that I’m running right now because I’m training for my first 5k this upcoming Thanksgiving. You can also set up a strength training plan in the app that works alongside the run training program giving you a daily/weekly breakdown. There are videos integrated into the workout routine if you need help understanding the mechanics of a workout. Currently my plan has 3 run days and 4 strength days. Two of those strength days I add on my own personal strength programs I’ve made. \n\nStretching and mobility. There is some mobility stuff in the Runna strength training because it’s geared toward running. But I try to get in a yoga sesh or two a week to focus on stretching and mobility.",

I too have struggled with discouraging moments while distance running and it’s normal.\n\nI’m not sure if you’re able so this is being said without context, but I recommend that rather than ramping up distance, you ramp up consistency.\n\nLong runs are an exceedingly important part of training. But, to reap the most benefits of your training, I recommend running equal to or less than your current daily mileage 5 - 6 times a week instead of 3 times a week.\n\nThis will do two things -\n\n1. This will make you more injury resistant because you’ll build the strength needed in your muscles and tendons in your legs over a consistent number of weeks and months, rather than a run here and there. Our bodies adjust to a schedule in a way. \n\n2. This will also consistently flush out natural byproducts of distance running in your blood like lactic acid which make your legs feel sluggish. \n\nRegarding the mental block, there is no silver bullet, although I wish there was.\n\nI have found, which is why I started with the few paragraphs above, that I feel better about my long runs when I’ve adequately prepared. I can stay mentally focused because I’ve done the work to accomplish a solid long run. \n\nIt’s also important that your diet before the run be intentional. I’ve written about this in a previous post, but the days leading up to a long run our bodies need healthy fats as a source of energy because our bodies can burn these fats longer and more efficiently than that of carbohydrates.\n\nAfter each run, you can also help yourself prepare for the next run by recovering the most effectively, with 15 - 20 grams of protein. Your body will have created micro - tears in your muscles after the run, and protein fills these tears to build stronger and more fatigue resistant strength. \n\nFailing to prepare is preparing to fail, which is a corny saying but it’s very true. \n\nI hope this helps?",

On your longer runs, how much and how early do you start fueling? \n\nAlso, you’re kind of still in the mile range where bumping up your distance is going to feel hard ( the difference between 6 miles and 8 miles is like 33%).  To the other posters point, adding an additional run or two around the 5-6 mile mark will be really helpful I think, and building that deeper base will make the increases in longer run distance feel easier. \n\nAlso also, training blocks can be hard. We all have good weeks and bad weeks, so be sure to feel it and give yourself some grace, and then keep on moving. Good luck!",

I’m so happy for you.\n\nTo address your question, I’ll start from run prep and conclude at run recovery.\n\nIt’s been stated all over this sub, but invest in a good pair of shoes. Running shoe stores often try to upsell you to the most expensive pair of socks, shoes, and other pieces of gear possible.\n\nThey often offer scans in their stores where they’ll tell you what your foot type is (supination, pronation, or neutral) - avoid those.\n\nSupination and pronation are natural motions for our feet, but a neutral shoe will support and help your foot land in the healthiest way possible. Running comfortably in a neutral shoe requires a strong arch so I would recommend investing time into strengthening your foot and calf muscles (google will help you find the appropriate exercises) so you don’t injure yourself running in a shoe that supports a supinating or pronating motion. \n\nNike makes a shoe called the Nike Pegasus that you can purchase for ~$100, which will help you save money as well.\n\nSecond, it’s hard to know what type of runs to do. Often folks who are starting out will consider their most difficult or longest runs to be the most valuable for their fitness. It is quite the opposite. Consistently running 2 - 3 miles a day for 5 - 6 days a week for the first several weeks will yield the best results. Try to stick to dirt, a track, wood chips, or grass. This will not only protect your body in the near term, but it will also strengthen, because of the unevenness of the surface, the muscles and tendons around your feet and ankles preventing future injuries.\n\nPost run, your body will have created micro tears in your muscles. I usually give recommendations to folks to consume a certain QTY of grams of protein post run. Instead, with context in mind about your recovery, I recommend consuming protein after your run when you can, while primarily following your sponsor or doctor’s advice about your diet. It’s most important to know that your body will recover faster and you will build stronger and more fatigue resistant muscles if you consume protein afterwards, that’s all. \n\nYou are doing great. I’ll keep an eye out in this subreddit for your future half marathon post.\n\nI hope this helps?",

I like apps like couch to 5k, and none to run. They'll start with the run/walk method.

Not foot locker, not dick's. An actual running store. As far as clothes, stick to synthetic if you can. Wear what you have if you can. At least until you find what you like. As a running coach once described, finding what you like is a years long journey. So don't buy because it's popular.",

It's one of the reasons they are so satisfying to complete.

Marathoners talk about 20 miles being the first half of the race and the last 6 the other half for a reason.  Don't worry about DNFing.  You stopped for a good reason and even at that, you ran way more than those who were standing on the sidelines.

                    "body": "Here is the only advice that has helped me: Stop being at the whim of your dopamine system or any other feelings. Your dopamine system wants quick and easy dopamine and it will do lots of things in order to make you do what it wants. Running obviously doesn't offer that quick dopamine. Quite the opposite, it feels quite uncomfortable. So that's when your dopamine tanks and when your brain gets riled up in order to get you away from running. This is what you call \"hyperfxation.\" It's basically a dopamine system craving its drug.\nSo the only advice that has helped me is this: The only way out is the way through. Go willingly into the pain cave. Don't be afraid of feeling uncomfortable. Don't try to avoid it. Yes, you can listen to podcasts and music, that's all fine. You don't need to torture yourself. But don't try to find a way out of that, because there is none. Life sometimes is uncomfortable and boring and there are no fixes for that.\nAdditionally, let's reframe boredom. So boredom is something which is actually very normal in the human experience. But our society panics even at the mere thought that we could get bored (thus the creation of all those dopamine superstimulis). But let's be honest. Why flee from boredom? Why flee from hyperfixation? Why treat it as if it's a tiger nipping at our heels? Is boredom going to kill us? No? So why do we treat boredom as if it might? Are we stronger or is boredom stronger? Do we want to develop discipline and will or do we want to strengthen dopamine addiction and flee from uncomfortable feelings?\n\nYou know what helps me personally to keep my feet grounded and my head straight? During my holidays in the Philippines, I saw a mother wash her child in a rain puddle. If you see that and think about it, all our problems just look so utterly absurd in comparison. There was a mother who wished to have running water. Yet here we are in our privileged lives complaining about the weather, boredom, our feet, how our couch is more comfortable than that run and so on. Don't be controlled by your fault-finding mind that wants to manipulate you into short-term dopamine. Be your own boss. So next time when you encounter boredom, be the boss inside your head. Say what you want to do and do it. State with courage that you are willing to face boredom head-on without moving an inch to the side or back. If you do that daily, your character will have changed for the better. Good luck!",

It's a really crappy feeling, especially when you are feeling so motivated before injury.\n\nHere are some things that I remind and tell myself when I get injured and I hope it can be of some help to you too.\n\nFirstly, I've accepted that injuries happen. There isn't an athlete in the world who hasn't gotten injured before, so you shouldn't blame yourself for getting injured. In fact, it's part of becoming a better runner. It's literally part of the experience.\n\nYou pointed out that you ramped up a bit too fast, and for me personally, that's the number one reason I get injured as well. Taking an extended break, and then thinking I can jump right back into the thick of it. The fact that you realized this is valuable experience going foward.\n\nThere are still a lot of things you can still do. You mentioned that the lack of routine is hurting you. I get it. But if there's any other form of exercise you can do without over exerting your hamstring, I would recommend you do it. For example, incline walking on a treadmill, or even just walking in general if you're unable to handle an incline at the moment. If you're able to do these without hurting your hamstring can still build your cardio and help rehab your hamstring. If you have access to a pool, you can try to rehab and build cardio there as well. Sticking to a routine and building the habit, even if it isn't as intense as your usual runs can go a long way. Also, moving your hamstring is valuable and can help you rehab faster as long as your body isn't giving you signals to stop. Do as much as your body allows you to.\n\nYou can also work on flexibility/yoga/stretching, but of course I would recommend to start slower. Even just 15 minutes a day can help you. There are plenty of good follow-along videos on YouTube. And the increased range of motion could help you avoid injury again in the future once you've fully recovered.\n\nFinally, you mentioned that you wanted to lose some weight. I'm sure you've already looked into it, but you could experiment with recipes and stuff to help you eat less calories, but still get the nutrition you need. Weight loss truly happens in the kitchen, and as they say, you can't outrun an bad diet.\n\nI hope you make a swift recovery, and use this experience to become a better runner. Like I said, it's part of it, and you'll become better at running without injuring yourself. And in the case that you do you injure yourself again, you'll know how to recover even faster. You got this.",

The latter while running is a sure way to get an injury that *forces* you to stop, often for long periods of time. You should be working with your doctor and/or a sports physiologist to figure out how to do this safely.\n\nSharp/shooting pain aside, I am willing to bet you are struggling with the mental aspect and hate running because you are torturing yourself running near max heart rate. It's uncomfortable. You save that for race day and for occasional high intensity workouts, which expose you to that discomfort in bursts of time that are mentally manageable for your skill level.\n\n80% of your running should be at an easy pace (you can talk in full sentences while running). For beginners, this is so slow it doesn't even feel like running. It's fine to to walk/run intervals. Easy runs don't even feel like a workout and many often wonder how this could possibly make you a faster runner, especially people from a weightlifting \"train to failure\" mentality, but it drives certain aerobic adaptations that are absolutely needed for running fast.\n\nThose easy run days are super enjoyable. I'm out there enjoying the outdoors, looking at people's pretty landscaping in front of their house, jogging around a lake, watching the sun rise or set. On night runs I'm busting out the headlamp and seeing interesting critters like spiders, praying mantis, even a toad one evening. No mental fortitude needed to jog at an easy pace.",

I’ll see a light pole a few hundred feet ahead and make sure I don’t stop til I get there, then once I do, just pick another before stopping.\n\nAnother thing that helps me, if you run in the morning or evening is to just keep your head up and look at the sunrise/sunset and just do some gratitude exercises. Speak to the universe, god or whatever you like and just go over everything you’re thankful for, I like to go over my whole body, “I’m thankful for my heart and that I have the ability to strengthen it, I’m thankful for my feet that they work and I’m lucky enough to be able to run.. etc.”\nThat helps to get your mind off the pain.\n\nAnd lastly what I’ll do when it’s really hard to battle the mental, is to kind of berate myself. Maybe this is more of a male thing, but I just tell myself something like “Don’t be a bitch, keep pushing and don’t quit because only losers quit.

                    "body": "The following advice is completely anecdotal, as I have learned there is no such thing as \"the right way\" to do...well, anything.\n\nWhat I've found personally works for me:\n\n**- Not eating before under the average weekday distance.** If I eat before a morning, I usually have a sugar-crash mid-run or at least feeling like something is bouncing in my guts. This is just me—as I'm a bit more fat-adapted (using bodily fat stores for fuel and less pre-run carbs). If you try this and get woozy, you may need some light, easily digestible food (oatmeal, banana, etc.) before.\n\nBut I go throw back some electrolytes and a protein shake afterward—especially for longer runs.\n\nHydration, on the other hand, is a must. I start hydrating for a morning run the minute I wake up. (But go pee before you leave. There's nothing worse than having to whiz on a run.)\n\n**- The more I become an obsessive student of running technique, the less pain and injury I encounter.** And while there's no such thing as \"the right way\" or \"the wrong way\" to run overall, there usually is a right and wrong way *for you*. Figuring out what works will save you a lot of hurt. But there *is* a general understanding that landing with a bent knee and a your feet landing beneath your pelvis is better than landing with a straighter knee out in front of you.\n\nFav books on running technique: Run For Your Life by Dr. Mark Cucuzzella  \n[https://amzn.to/3XFH5yX](https://amzn.to/3XFH5yX) and Older Yet Faster: The Secret to Running Faster and Injury-Free by Keith Bateman and Heidi Jones  \n[https://amzn.to/3VIXwrx](https://amzn.to/3VIXwrx) ---- but that being said, you need to find a technique that works for you. I usually let my legs tell me what works.\n\n**- Systems checks can help make hard runs easier.** When I find myself getting tired and my form falling apart (shoulders slouched, harder foot falls, etc.), I take myself through a body check: Shoulders relaxed. Legs light, quick, and bouncy. Stature feeling like I have one string pulling me up from the crown of the head and another string pulling me forward from my belly button (my late grandmother taught me that one, rest her soul).\n\n**- Keeping most runs conversational.** If I'm running hard enough to where I don't feel like I could carry on a conversation with someone or sing a tune, I ease up until I can. That usually will keep your heart rate in \"Zone 2\" - or the aerobic state. It may seem slow as heck or even just speed walking, but as your endurance and fitness increase, your pace will as well over time.\n\nThat being said, if you feel like letting 'er rip every once in a while, go for it. Absolutely gassing yourself from time to time can be good fun.\n\n**- If, after a run, I don't feel like I could do it all over again, I probably went too hard.** I got that one from Dr. Mark Cucuzzella, esteemed doctor, running coach, and sub-3-min Boston Marathoner for over the last 30 years.\n\n**- If you're thirsty, yes, drink water during your run**. Especially if its hot. And consider some electrolyte replacement if you're sweating buckets (you lose a lot of minerals in sweat). I don't know if that's anecdotal because it just seems like good sense. I carry a handstrapped bottle pretty much every single run these days.\n\nOk, I could probably keep going but I'll stop here. Just remember to listen to your body. Don't overdue it because of an arbitrary goal (way too easy to do). Take care of yourself. And most importantly — **HAVE FUN**.",

My advice: \n\n*Make sure to bring water. You can get a hydration backpack or a runner’s Fanny pack if you don’t want to carry it. The water should be around room temperature (your body absorbs it better) and you should drink in small sips spread out throughout the run not large gulps (so you don’t throw up) \n*Wear a hat, sunglasses, and of course sun screen. \n*Wet your hair. Just stick your head into the shower and pull it into a ponytail if it’s long before you head out. It’ll keep your entire body temperature down. \n*Run at or near sunset. Sunrise is also good but I’m not a morning girly lol so I do sunset. I don’t like running in the dark cause it doesn’t feel safe but it’ll be coolest as the sun is going down. \n*If you can’t run at sunset because your schedule won’t allow it, try searching for a route that has lots of shady bits. \n*Have a cool treat waiting for you when you get home. I’m doing smoothies. When I get back I start my recovery by drinking one glass of room temperature water. Then I switch to ice water while I make my smoothie\n*If you’re really desperate, get a portable fan. I have one I bring with me everywhere that charges and folds in half. My dad has one that hangs on his neck that might be really nice for a run.",

Our society and some people (even doctors) make dealing with being overweight difficult. For me, when I see someone heavier at the gym, or at my local parkrun (these are very inclusive and friendly), I am usually thinking I have a lot more respect for them than the super-fit gym rats. It's easy to be at the gym wearing shorts and a tank, when you look good. It takes some real mental toughness to go, and keep going, when you feel like you don't fit some artificial standard of physical fitness/appearance.\n\nSo, first, acknowledge the part of yourself that feels this way. The feelings are real. Second, acknowledge the part of yourself that wants to be healthy (forget weight).\n\nI don't know you, so I can't advise the best strategy for getting through this (not around). Yes, there is a component that is your perception, about what others will think, to work through, and there is a part that is real. Some people may think, or even say something. The thing is, what they say or think is way less important than what you think. What is difficult is that when someone else makes a negative comment, it affects us because we allow it to affect us, because we're already doubting ourselves. Our value, worth, attractiveness, or whatever.\n\nFind some positive affirmations and/or images to inspire you to get out and to stick with it. See if you can recruit a friend to go with you. Workout buddies help us to be accountable, and can make us less of a target for the idiots. Depending where you live, there may be women's running groups. Check your local running shoe stores, the STRAVA app, etc.\n\nFind the part of yourself that wants to be healthy and figure out how to make that more important than what you fear about being seen. You CAN do this, if you only let yourself.\n\n\"Today, like every other day, we wake up empty  \nand frightened. Don’t open the door to the study  \nand begin reading.

Motorcycles are notoriously difficult to get repaired in the summer due to wait time. \n\nSo I ended up walking to work for 3 months…here’s what I learned that every overweight beginning runner should know.  \n\n*Shoes are just marketing, get yourself some hiking boots…this will keep the plantar away and offer ankle support. I used oboz if interested. \n*Diet & fasting are king. Anything that causes additional inflammation will short circuit your progress…focus on stocking fat, fiber and protein in your fridge. I’d sear turkey bacon and that steam/stirfry kale, I’d make really hearty salads(with lots of eggs) and then add Cheesecake Factory ranch for a supreme yet somewhat flavor. I’d also make spinach, banana and vegan protein powder smoothies. The Spanish provides magnesium to avoid you from cramping and the bananas help in a similar capacity.  I also learned to force myself to go to bed…this thing gets a ton earlier if you’re getting 8+ hours per night. \n*Learn to stretch and take as much time as you need….avoiding injuries entails learning to listen to your body and not feel the stress from peer pressure.  \n*Get a fitness tracker, understand when your heart rate is too high and pursue your goals in waves. \n*Lastly, give yourself recovery days…hit the sauna, use trx bands for subsidized stretching and just sun bathing on the days where I was sore(oh yea, get tested for vitamin D deficiencies…if needed start supplementing because that plays a role in recovery). \n\nI lost 65lbs in a summer and enjoyed every empowering moment of it once I found what worked for me. \n\nI truly wish you the best on your journey. \n\nLast takeaway, I also starting using those toe shoes on recovery days….it just helped to stamp out any soreness that I had from my endurance runs…I walked everywhere SLOWLY 🐢in them, it was like foam rolling for my feet…\n\nAll the best…",

Then walk further and try to go faster. Then carry some hand weights. And buy a rain coat, a thin one to remove the excuse of it's raining. Stay hydrated. Add electrolytes to the water. Set realistic goals. A mile a day 4 days a week. Up it to a mile and a half or two miles if it's not enough of a challenge. Write it on a board too. Saturday, Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday or whatever so you can mark it off when done. Get a Garmin watch that will track your mileage, heart rate and daily steps etc. good shoes are critical. Allow yourself rewards too. Whether it's a daily distance weekly distance, pounds or pants size. Don't say I want to run a marathon and then give up in Two months because you're not ready. Set ever increasing attainable goals and give yourself a reward for hitting that goal. Whether it's dinner and wine or a scoop of ice cream, if you deprive yourself the chance of failure is greater. \n\nAnd don't worry about anyone else and what they think.

I get flareups a lot that can keep me out of the gym sometimes, make me feel weak. I grew up closer to my Dad in my younger years; it became a large part of my identity to be as physically self-sufficient as possible, to be able to do any physical task without a man's help (I'd seek out the most laborious tasks when helping my dad with physically taxing things, and I'd feel him swell with pride when he saw me holding up okay and eager for the next task.)\n\nI can get imposter syndrome in the gym, I can struggle with trying to find what amount of weight my joints can handle on a given day.

Some friends talked me into the group fitness classes which was way out of my comfort zone. I was wrecked walking in the first time thinking about how I was going to embarrass myself. Could I keep up? I’m not that coordinated. Everyone is going to be looking at me. We set up. The class was packed. I was dying inside. The instructor welcomed new faces which was really nice, but I didn’t want any extra attention. And then the magic started. Lights dimmed a bit. Music started pumping. Everybody was keeping the beat while lifting weights, watching their form in the mirrors. It was exhilarating. Nobody was watching me. The instructor went through the room and gave some postural advice to lots of people who looked like they knew what they were doing to me. She helped me a little. Nobody cares. I did my thing. They did their thing. When we were done we were all sweaty and spent and smiling and talking about how she kicked our asses. People who looked like they were in great shape were just as done as me. It’s so hard to tell how fit someone is just by looking at someone. The class was fun.  The music was great. I was lost in a crowd just doing my thing. I loved it. And those classes really helped me mentally and physically. People were supportive of each other. It’s hard for somebody to be an asshole in a group of 30. You tend to bond more seeing the same faces every week. As opposed to running on a treadmill and feeling like the fat dad dying in the middle of a sea of perfect people (nearly all of whom were supportive if they even noticed, but we all get stuck in the narrative in our head) I found it somehow easier to throw myself in a room full of people and just go with it. I thought everyone would be staring at me and it was the opposite. It was just one big group getting through it together. I just focused on the music and my workout. Weirdly I could feel more anonymous in a group than by myself. And then I made a bunch of friends too. Perhaps the 5K will be the same kind of experience for you. Have fun with it. If someone is ever a dick to you rest assured it’s not just you. They look for things to hassle anybody and pick even the most fit people apart. Fuck them. Do your thing and love your life.

It’s what matters the most. Not other people’s opinions, just your own. Here’s something I practice- when you find yourself having a negative internal dialogue, tell yourself the opposite of whatever it is you’re thinking. “I’m not good enough, people think I have no business doing this” turns into “I am good enough and I’m working on myself, it doesn’t matter what other people think because I’m doing this for me, not them.” This can be particularly hard as a woman because we are taught to put other people’s needs above our own. The truth is that self care makes us better for those around us, not just ourselves. \n\nUnderstand that no one else knows what is going on inside your head and also know that when and if you have negative interactions with others, they’re not thinking about it later. Their thoughts do not pay your “bills,” internally or otherwise. The random glare or snicker really means jack shit in the grand scheme of things. \n\nDo not let yourself bully, yourself! It also helps to ask yourself what you’d say to someone you love, if they were in your situation and treat yourself just as kindly. \n\nOne last thing, good for you for taking initiative and caring for yourself.

Some will think: good for her, trying like that. Others will notice and not think much at all because you only impinged on their thoughts for a second or two while they were busy somewhere else inside their heads. So the point is none of that matters, and you can prove that to yourself: when each individual has a perspective, the one that counts is yours. It’s like voting: do you make up your own mind? You can tell when group perspective matters. You’re likely in groups and you share perspectives. But when you’re talking about your own personal improvement desires, and all those bad noises in your head, then the only perspective which matters is yours. If you’re uncomfortable in your body, get through the resistance to change which is within you. One way to think of it is to view your body as being on a path or trajectory. That path has momentum and inertia. It wants to keep going. It wants you to be unhappy because that’s what unhappiness does: it tries to take over through whatever cracks it can find. When you have a weight problem, unhappiness can really dig in. It says things like you’re only happy when you eat, and that leaves you unhappy nearly all the time. Stop listening to what you imagine are other perspectives. That’s your current path fighting for control of your direction. One step at a time. Put one foot in front of the other.

Study up on form whether you are on weights or jogging. For jogging -- many years ago I overdid it and ended up with some type of long term shin splint that bothered me for years. My general self-placed rule is if my feet, shins or knees hurt very much when I first get put of bed, I don't run that day. Maybe even a day or two past that. Muscle soreness okay. Not joint or bone-type aches such as shins.\n\nMy main point is, Do NOT push through on early signs of an injury! It's okay to rest. Do a different exercise like lifting, exercise bike or swimming to do active recovery if you think it appropriate.\n\nI was recently having some pains in my heels from running. I took most of last month off from running (unfortunately I did not follow my advice and hop on a bike or lift weight). My heels are fine now, but I did have a setback on my endurance which Im okay with. \n\nIf I had kept running like I was, my feet only would have gotten worse and likely could have resulted in more down time trying to recover from a sure enough injury.\n\nActive recovery is great, but make 100% sure you get recovery, whether it is active or inactive, imo.\n\nAlso...stretches! I have been surprised to find some of my leg issues are simply tight calves, hamstrings or hips! \n\nEveryone is different, but do not disregard stretching as part of warmup as well as recovery. Whatever your ache is, google some stretches for that to see if that helps.\n\nThere are stretch routines for tight hips. Key words for that search may be \"hip opening stretches/exercises\".\n\nA yoga class may be good also if you can afford everything. Good for balance of body strenght and flexibility.\n\nSometimes its really not an injury so much as a tight muscle somewhere!\n\nGood luck! I'm honestly a little excited for you!",

You're essentially burning through energy faster than your body can create more of, and the only way you're going to improve that is by allowing your body the time and conditions to adapt. Slow down even if you think you're running slow and start to do more running/walking intervals. The key will be to maximize the time on your feet as that will force your body to adapt over time and you're not going to be able to do that with a sustained high heart rate. Do shorter running periods in-between longer walking ones, and over time you reduce the walking and increase the running. If you haven't followed a program like couch to 5K I would recommend that you do.\n\nSome people just have a higher heart rate than others, so focus more on keeping your workouts more where you feel in control of the run and you could be conversational with someone during it (this might be really hard at the start) instead of such a focus on your heart rate. When I first started my HR would shoot up and stay high, like yours, and it will improve over time but you just need to give your body the chance to adapt. Slowing down and more walking intervals will keep your heart rate lower, which will allow you to work out for a longer duration, which then allows your body to better adapt to the new stress you're putting on it.",

Come race day my heart rate was already in the high 170s sometimes reaching 180 at a pace of 5:05-5:15 after a few kilometers. Like you, should have taken the hint and go easier. Hit a wall at about 30K, where I saw my heart rate spiking at 186 going 5:30/KM and my legs just gave out. Immediately slowed down to let my HR drop. From then on it was just a sufferfest doing all I could to keep on running. Tried to pick up the pace a little bit a few times, but there was just nothing left. Ended up finishing just above 4:00 hours. Like you, I mentioned my 3:30 goal to everyone and like you, noby cares and is impressed with just finishing the damn thing. I guess it tells us something about their perspective as well as our own.\n\nI steel feel very proud though. The time might not have been what I had expected. But making it through that mental struggle for the last 12K feels like a major achievement that is unlike anything else I have experienced in sports. I'm also very intrigued by what I can do differently to crack the code for a more succesful marathon next time. For me I think it was mostly hydration on a day that was hotter and significantly more humid than the past weeks of training. Other than that I guess running the marathon no matter how hard you train there is no guarantee it will come out how you expect on race day.",

I attempted to run a half marathon in 2020 (not an organized race for obvious reasons lol, just training on my own) but I had to DNF the plan because I kept getting hurt. I know now that was at least partly due to pushing myself way too hard and never running at a truly easy pace. Somewhere along the way (I really don't know how) my brain internalized the idea that I *had* to run all my runs faster than a 10:00 mile pace, otherwise I was going too slow. I was capable of that pace but it certainly wasn't \"easy\" - especially for the 8-10 milers. \n\nAnyway, it's 5 years later and after running on and off for years I finally broke through that mental barrier by following a training plan that specifically told me to run in zone 2 on certain days, and that forced me to slow down bc no way was I gonna stay in zone 2 going more than 11:00-12:00 minutes per mile. At first, knowing that I was following \"the rules\" and sticking to the plan was legit the only thing forcing me to slow down, but after doing it for a few weeks...it completely changed my relationship with running. Going slow is actually so much fun. It's freeing to not care about pace and it is such a good feeling to finish a run and not be drenched in sweat and feeling like I'm about to die. And as a bonus, the days I do get to run fast are a) so much more fun and b) easier! I find myself easily hitting paces in the 7:30-8:30 range on my speed work days, which was never ever possible for me before. \n\nSo if you're a type A person like me I guess my advice is find a training plan that tells you specifically how fast/long to run on certain days so that you are forced to choose between following the rules and going fast 😂 not looking at my watch and just going by how I feel also helps",

It sounds like you're someone who is committed to a range of different fitness goals, and not training for a marathon doesn't mean you won't be staying active or pursuing progress elsewhere.

My personal feeling is that it's always going to be tough - so these personal motivations are important - but it should also be something you enjoy, and if it isn't there's really no shame at all in doing something else instead for a while.\n\nI'd pick the training up for a week again, see how that goes, then make a solid choice one way or another and commit to it.

Try not to spend the coming weeks training but constantly wondering whether you should just quit, or doing something else but constantly berating yourself for it.

And I run that movie so often that the perfect day becomes the expectation.  \n\nI don’t mean “expectation” in that if I don’t have a perfect day; I’ll be devastated.

Did I do enough _____? Is my fueling strategy the best? Should I try ____?  \n\nI just expect that my day is going to go well and that I am going to succeed in meeting my goals.  I don’t always, but having my head in a place where I am fully expecting to meet them seems to help when something goes off or I feel more fatigued than I’m expecting.

I teach myself that discomfort is simply the experience of pressure, and my brain is choosing to interpret that as discomfort, so I can choose to interpret each moment of pressure as an indication of strength (or whatever might be something that works for you).  True pain will always come through as pain, but general discomfort that comes from running for several hours over a lengthy distance isn’t “pain” that indicates injury.

But a sub-optimal headspace can virtually erase all of the benefits of training in the blink of an eye.  So I focus heavily on the brain games to make sure my head is going to be in the best possible spot.

What happened is that you have hit the peak of your training (which is generally when everyone is just beat and ready to taper), and you ran 20 miles off pretty low weekly mileage.  \n\nTo bang out a long run (with relative “ease”) and reasonably recover from it in a period of time that doesn’t run into upcoming runs, it’s recommended to keep that run to 20-30% of your weekly total.  So with your current weekly mileage, you’d be looking at a long run of 10-ish miles.  \n\nYou ran double that.  Amazing!  But that’s going to absolutely tax your body to an incredible level.  And it sounds like there haven’t been a lot (or any) cutback weeks or recovery periods?  So you are simply spent.  You’ve been working your body hard to train it, and you’re at the peak of training (when pretty much everyone is just done and over it) and you asked your body to go way way way above and beyond.  It’s not surprising that it rejected your request to go further.  \n\nThat doesn’t mean you’re not ready for your marathon.  And why you can take your 20 miler, put it in your pocket and take confidence that you can cover the other 6.2 on race day:\n\nYou’re going to taper now.  You’re going to cut your mileage WAY down.  You’re not going to get any more fit between now and the race.  What you want to do is let your body rest and recover.  This allows your body to heal up from everything you’ve done in training.  It will heal stronger than it was when you did the training.  But it has to be able to heal to get stronger. So you taper.  You cut your mileage (and don’t replace it with anything) so your body can heal.  \n\nThis resting is also going to give you a little more time to sleep (which is coincidentally when that healing happens), a little more R&R, a little less stress in your day.  All of this helps you heal and recover.  \n\nYou’re going to eat well like it’s your job.  You’re not going to try keto, you’re not going to try to drop a couple of pounds.  You’re going to eat well and refuel your glycogen stores (with carbs) that make your muscles work.  You’re going to eat foods that are full of protein, carbs and other nutrients.  \n\nAnd you’re going to arrive at your race feeling fresh as a daisy, strong, and more peppy than you have been in months.  You’re also going to have all the race day vibes, crowd support, race day adrenaline. And all of that is going to turn your freshly rested and fueled body into a gazelle.  And THAT is when you want to run more than 20.    Because that’s when it actually counts.  And that’s really the only time you need to.  And it will feel SO much better doing it on race day than if you try to tax your exhausted body into doing another long run that is well over 1/2 of your weekly mileage.  \n\nSo please enjoy your taper.  Enjoy the rest and recovery.  And show up on race day fired up, strong and ready to go.  And you will.  And you’ll find the 20 you run on race day will feel so much better than today’s (they will still be tough and long, but they will feel fueled and doable).  And then you’ll know that those 6.2 are totally yours for the taking.  \n\nSo have a sit.  Have a rest.  Enjoy making it through training in one piece.  And get ready to enjoy your marathon!",

If you are doing both of those, you're in better shape than you think. After that if comes down to 3 things fundamentally: Race strategy, nutrition, and mental toughness.\n\n**Race strategy:** Try the 10/10/10 plan --> first 10mi, next 10 mi, last 10k --> with the caveat that you may need to adjust your plan based on course terrain, etc, you run the \"first 10\" @ a touch below MP. There's no right or wrong answer but the point is to hold some energy in reserve while you get the nerves out and find a groove. For the \"Next 10\" you basically take back what you gave up in that first 10. So for example if you gave up 1-2 secs per mile in the first chunk, you take that same back in the next 10. For the \"last 10\" you start to push the pace up. You have to decide what that pace is and how you progress it. For an added bit of fun, I make a commitment to myself for the last 1 mi to be my fastest split. This means when you run past the mi 25 marker, you drop the hammer and give it all you got. Its surprisingly freeing and easier than it sounds.\n\n**Nutrition**: Before the race, you need to do a proper carb load. I prefer a 3 day carb load but if you're a smaller person, you might be able to pull off a 2-day. Do a quick search on 3-day carb load and you'll find all the info you need. During the race, you need to have a plan for A. Fluids B. Carbs C. Salts. I know exactly when I plan drink water vs gatorade, when I take gel, and when I swallow some extra salt pills\n\n**Mental toughness:** Marathons are hard and when you're done with it, you'll be happy it was hard. Embrace it. Make friends with the pain. Figure out ways to keep pushing yourself. Mentally prepare for it to start to really suck miles 13-18 b/c you still have lots to go but fatigue will start to set in. Miles 18 through the finish you will feel all sorts of stuff. That's normal. Roll with it, keep a cool head and remember your race strategy. If you put the work in before the race, your body will surprise you. If you didn't, you'll learn a great lesson for your next race.\n\nGOOD LUCK!!",

Going above and beyond that pace to unlock more speed is for much shorter quality sessions like intervals and tempo sessions.

You don’t have to kill youself on every workout.  Find a good audio book, run slow and actually enjoy it. \n\n2) you need to find ways to enjoy the process.  Make it more about getting in shape, improving your health, becoming a happier/better person, than about your time.  If you’re only trying to achieve a time, you won’t feel fulfilled and you open the door to lots of disappointment if you don’t hit it, despite actually accomplishing something awesome. \n\n3) be real with yourself about your level of fitness, and don’t push it too hard too fast.  The best way to prevent injuries is to ramp your training very slowly and really try to warm up and cool down after each run",

One is that your shoes are too big and your propioception is off with your foot landing so you keep catching your shoes on things and tripping. Second is that, under fatigue, you are picking up your feet less and moving into more of a shuffle type stride. I do this toward the end of my long runs and the tell for me is that I start accidentally kicking rocks and pebbles with my feet while I'm running. If that's the case, just be aware of it, and be careful of your foot placement. You can manage fatigue by making sure you're fuelling and hydrating appropriately. But the point of long runs is to build up fatigue, so you're always going to feel a bit of it regardless.\n\nGood luck - you can totally finish your marathon on 18 miles!",

My totally non scientific perspective is that it's not quite \"overtraining\" as that seems to be a more chronic issue, but rather it's just a symptom of \"overexertion\", a more short term issue.\n\nFrom my own experiences, I've noticed a night and day difference between refuelling right after a run vs compensating later in the day. The timing seems extremely critical.  \nI would suggest making sure you're consuming enough carbs during a long run or tough workout, and consuming food, water, and electrolytes right after a run makes all the difference. The sooner the better. It's hard to overdo the water especially with electrolytes at the same time, and keep your water intake high for the rest of the day. For me it doesn't go away completely, but it's the difference between being able to function after a long run vs a literal braindead vegetable on life support.\n\nIf it gets so bad you feel like you can't function in life anymore, just forget about maximising your 12 week training plan and take a few rest days, and I'm sure you'll feel a lot better.\n\nI wish you the best of luck!",

I honestly think that having run the full 26.2 helped me physically and more importantly psychologically for the second one.",

You even say it in your OP, that you want to do this for a mental (ego) benefit.\n\nTraining is about creating an overload stimulus to make the body adapt but only enough to cause adaption and not significantly increase risk of burnout or injury.   To that end, the relative load need to be in-line with your weekly volume.\n\nI'd recommend trying to cap the long run at ma 30% of weekly volume.\n\n  \nAt 45 miles a week (av 6.4 miles a day),  30% would be 13.5 miles only!!  Not really enough\n\nSubtracting the 13.5 long run would leave 31.5 miles for the remaining 5-6 days (so 5.25 or 6.3 miles per day  average).\n\nPerhaps obviously, this is not enough.   There is good reason any decent entry level Marathon plan starts at 55 miles a week minimum and thats in order to even balance suitable traininng load across the week.   Of course more advanced runners will be running higher volumes for 10K training and train for Marathon anywhere form 60-100 miles per week.\n\n  \nLooking at a typical interval session, which most plans will have twice a week, we can see that session alone is about 10 miles:\n\nEG:  \nTuesday track - 12 x 400m at 5K pace with 400m jog recovery\n\n\\^ Thats 4.8K quality + 4.8K recovery = 6 miles\n\n\\+ 2-3 mile warmup (2+ miles jog, then some strides)\n\n\\+ 1 -2 miles cool down\n\n= 9 - 11 miles for this one session.\n\n  \nx 2 and thats at least 18 miles just on those 2 quality days.\n\n3 more easy run days at 6.3 miles minimum = 18.9 miles, so 37 miles total,  which would suggest a log run of about 15.5 miles.  \n\nOf course, a better way to balance load would be to increase the duration of one or more of those easy runs to match or exceed the volume of a session day.       If one is 9 miles, that brings your total volume up.  2 days at 9 miles is better and you might drop 1 mile or two on the other day.    \n\nThis is more balanced and less likely to burn you out or injure you and gives a a better stimulus to adapt throughout the week.\n\n  \nRunning to ego will only increase risk of fatigue and injury and ultimately slow times if you can even start.",

The last few weeks of “peak” training are rarely a good indication of race day performance because the body is SO fatigued. Don’t underestimate the effect of the taper. \n\n2. Coming out of the peak weeks and into taper is also really hard mentally. Again, don’t underestimate how much rest can improve mental game (before my last marathon I crawled into the taper and felt like I’d run the race in my head too many times to the point where I was too exhausted to actually do it, a few weeks later with some good carbs in me I felt good)\n\n3. The story we tell ourselves is self-fulfilling. It’s ok (and completely understandable) to know you’ll feel defeated and disappointed if you don’t hit your goal.

My advice would be that there’s not much point thinking about goals now. I would just keep up the training load, make sure you are following some kind of sensible structure (e.g. one speed session, one longer run per week and the rest pretty comfortable) and run some 5k or 10k benchmarks in a month or two before starting into a more focused half marathon block.

I blew up at Mile 19 and barely managed to limp the rest of the way in. I was super disappointed as I feel like I’m in the best shape of my life and was really hoping for a big record time. \n\nHere’s what I’ve been focusing on: You listened to your body and made a choice that maximized your ability to run long-term. It was a very challenging day, and lots of people had issues. One person I saw on social media had stability issues and then got hypothermia when they had to stop. The cold was sneaky, and it definitely contributed to my challenges…I bet it did for you too. None of that was in your control, and for what was in your control you made a good choice. \n\nPlus, the Disney races are more about being there than anything else. If you made it to MK, you saw most of the good parts of the course…the rest of it is pretty boring. There’s always the next race for a good finish, and it will probably have better course support and free beer at the end to celebrate. :)",

Its great to hear you had a support system on the day of the race, that's huge. Hold onto that.\n\nI had IT Band issues with my most recent marathon as well, the Marine Corps back in October. 7 weeks out and it hit me like a ton of bricks. I hadn't had IT band syndrome since junior year of high school track, well over a decade ago. Sure, there is cross training, and I still had my pool open to use. But forcing ourselves to take some time off from running while we've got the momentum going is tough. Harder on us mentally even more than physically at times, right? While race day didn't turn out to be what you hoped, remember that you still went out there and gave it your all. That even before race day, you got up and tried again with the training. That passion and love for the marathon, don't let that burn out. This is just one race, there are so many other opportunities out there. Sign up for that next one when YOU'RE ready.\n\nNow is the time to rest and recuperate. At least two weeks off, no running or even walking for fitness. Remember that you already have the will and determination to get up and try again. So you can and will do it, I believe in you. Give yourself a break, I know that's tough to hear. You are deserving of it, and your body will thank you. Keep up the stretches, and any leg day work at the gym that could help. While I was able to make it on my race day, I haven't stopped doing the stretches. Nor has the PTSD of what that training did to me fully wore off. When the going gets tough, us runners get up and try again. It's what we know and DO best. We may be a large community but know this: You are not alone.",

Try to get out the door and promise myself that I can quit after 1 mile if I still feel like it.

Give yourself permission to quit a run after a mile. Getting up and out the door is the toughest, but once you get going it's much easier to continue to do so. I've quit maybe 1 or 2 runs after that mile, so I know the option is there for real, but 90% of the time I'll keep going after getting out the door. \n\nThe best, but hardest to organize, is a running buddy or group, as having that early morning commitment to others is far more motivating than just yourself. \n\nGood luck! Your not alone- tons of folks are feeling the exact same feelings as you are. Stay strong, you can do tough things!!\n\nEdit: Race anxiety. I definitely feel this.

Slowly ease back into some runs to avoid burn out.",

First, let me reassure you: you haven’t blown all the hard work you’ve put in. Training is rarely linear, and setbacks like holidays, illness, and life stressors are part of the process. The strength you’re building goes beyond just miles—it’s in your resilience, too.\n\nThe exhaustion and burnout you’re feeling are valid, especially with the demands of your corporate job, safety concerns, and the mental load of training. It’s no small feat to balance everything, and yet here you are, showing up and moving forward. That’s something to be deeply proud of.\n\n**Here’s what I’d suggest to help recalibrate:**\n\n* **Listen to your body:** Taking extra rest days or adjusting mileage to prioritize recovery could reignite your energy.\n* **Reflect on your \"why\":** Reconnect with the reasons this goal matters to you. It’s easy to lose sight of it when burnout creeps in.\n* **Break it down:** Instead of focusing on the 18 weeks as a whole, celebrate the small victories each week brings.\n* **Shake up your routine:** If laps around your apartment complex are mentally draining, consider treadmill sessions or exploring safer daylight running options- whether it's finding a run club or other individuals who are running. If you're in South Florida, Philadelphia, Baltimore/DC, or Austin- let me know, have a few specifics I can recommend. \n\nI work exclusively with women like you—juggling big goals, careers, and life—and I specialize in creating training approaches that align with your body and life rhythms. Together, we can work on strategies that build not just your physical stamina but also nurture your mental and emotional resilience.\n\nIf you're curious, let’s connect—I’d love to see how I can help you cross that sub-4 finish line feeling strong, fulfilled, and proud. 💛",

Other comments on this thread are right when they say that it can seem like everyone else is smashing these huge times. It’s not like that.

I’ve seen from other comments that you’re following Hal Higdon’s plan, but speaking from the experience of someone who has trained for marathons both using a premade plan and with the help of a coach, I think that this may be an important factor in why you feel like your results don’t match your efforts. (Obviously, I don’t recommend switching in the middle of a block)\n\nGranted, having a personalized plan is more expensive than a free online resource, but if you’re in a position lucky enough to afford one, I would really, really recommend it.  My biggest takeaways from hiring a coach was that a) I could, in fact, increase my mileage by a lot without injury (by adjusting the amount/intensity of my runs) and that b) there were so many fun types of training sessions which I would never think of, yet which have my results significantly.\n\nAlso, I don’t think you should diminish yourself so much because of your height! I happen to have  female friends who are running crazy fast times (I’m talking sub-17 5ks) while being well below 5ft.

Once it's joy and not a punishment to go out for a run, the progress will go up rapidly. Read \"Born to run\". Write down a list of people who you'll think about during the long runs. Find podcasts to listen to.\n3. Stay fit, don't neglect what your body tells you. I ignored signs of cold for weeks last November and ended up with pneumonia for Christmas. It, not surprisingly, significantly screwed up the progress I made. Do some exercises to build up the core muscles, even if it'd be once a week it will make difference. I signed up to Freeletics and am quite happy with the exercises it offers as I hate doing same routines over and over but too lazy to plan workouts myself.\n\nEnjoy the journey.

Id recommend you do two things. \n\nFirst, change direction occasionally. On the outdoor runs I changed direction every 4 miles. The races would have us do it every 30 minutes. They’d put a cone on the track and when you got there, you go around it and move to the outside lanes. When all the runners had reversed direction, we’d collapse to the inside lanes. The field was limited to 40 runners so it was easy to see that everyone had reversed direction.  \n\nSecond, it’s surprisingly easy to lose track of what lap you are on. I put 3 stones in my right pocket. Every mile I’d move one to my left pocket. When I got to mile 4, I’d return the stones to my right pocket and reverse direction. \n\nIn some respects a perfectly flat track sounds easy, but I found it more tiring. It’s using the same muscles the same way for the entire distance. With some variation in terrain, you tax your muscles differently; some get a break and others work harder. This won’t happen on a flat track. Still, it’s great mental training.  After all, it’s just one run. I don’t find hill workouts especially fun, but I do them anyway.",

I am grateful for the knowledge from doing bad with halfs (did 10k in 66 mins, 10 mile in 1hr 55 mins but half in 2 hr 55 mins with 3 miles of walking after cramps).

                    "body": "I'd say consistency is key.  Definitely the most important thing before anything else like mileage, pace, all that stuff.\n\nLook at how much you run weekly now.  How many days of the week do you run and how many miles per week/day?  Just start at some basic base building, run 5-6 days a week, take a day off from running for strength/cross training/ entirely off for recovery.  This also helps if you're a person with a life/family/social stuff/work.\n\nIt's way better to run 40 miles a week for 10 weeks than it is to try to up your mileage every other week with the following week being recovering from that week or being at risk of injury.  I treat my training like climbing Lhotse.  Get to a comfortable weekly mileage, that's your base camp one.  Hang out there for 3-4 weeks.  Try to keep things consistent jf possible (long run same day, strength training the same day, recovery runs, workouts, training run distances all the same for each week). Build that mental routine and get the body comfortable at that mileage.  And this can be a +/-  5 miles let's say.  Don't kill yourself to be literally the same but within a few miles is perfect.  Then after a month or so up the mileage on some of the runs.  Or up the intensity.  It's typically not recommended to do both at the same time since it can really strain the body, one or the other.  Add more mileage or run faster miles at the same Miles per week.  That'll be base camp 2.  Hang out there until you feel like you're finishing your run/week saying \"Thats it?  Wow that really flew by\". Trust me, that happens.  Then just keep progressing to the next base camp until you feel like you've got your ideal peak training mileage (daily training runs, long runs).\n\nIdeally long runs are meant to be 1.5x your average daily run mileage.  So my longer runs are 16-22 as I ramp up marathon training with my daily single runs being between 10-12 miles.  If your daily running is 3 miles then your long run could be 7-8 to start and then up it accordingly.  The long run typically being slower than other runs to build an aerobic base and get you used to being on your feet longer.  I'd recommend trying to get, at least, into the double digits for your long run if you're going to try marathoning.  Both for the aerobic gain and the mental assurance that you know you've at least run 14 miles before.  Remember, just because youve never run 26 miles in training doesn't mean you can't do it for the race.  It just helps your confidence to know you can focus and be on your feet for a while before entering the race.\n\nMarathoning is something I believe anyone can do, it's just a matter of consistent training and not being afraid of the distance name.  Also fueling is important.  If youre about a 30 minute 5k runner and marathon is 42k, plan to be on your feet for 4-5 hours.  Practicing fueling with gels will be helpful since that's a long time to be exerting yourself.\n\nI'd say I spend probably 10-15 hours a week with marathon training.  And that's everything for me: running, socializing, strength stuff, PT visits.  Definitely find a running group near you too.  So many people love to talk running and guidance for marathons.  Free training partners too, which is always welcome.  They can also help you plan your race schedule.  Half marathons/10ks/fun other distances to prep for the marathon.  Perfect for seeing where you are in training and also can be perfect for weekends in which you need to get in a tempo workout run but don't want to. No better way than to travel with some people to the local 5 miler and have at it.  Maybe even get a beer after.\n\nHere's the skinny nobody tells you.  When you go from no running to marathon training, you'll be hungry all the freaking time.  So prepare to snack and buy what you think is enough food for the week only to realize it's gone by Tuesday",

There are many plans available, such as Hal Higdon and others you can find on the web.\n\nOutside of the plan, I’m normally running 5 or 6 days a week, about 25-30 miles a week. \n\nSo once training starts, the beginning of the plan isn’t much different than what I normally do. But the long runs start to ramp up. I normally get in three 20 mile runs in my plan.\n\nI get out in the early morning to train. With Philly being in November, you’ll start training at the end of summer and early runs are really nice for cooler temps and plus you’ll have the rest of the day. I was starting at 4 am sometimes for my long runs.\n\nIf you’re younger and in good shape, you could do it. But you don’t want to wait until 18 weeks out. I’d recommend getting in a few 10k’s and half marathons this spring. See how you do. If you feel good with your half marathons, you’ll be ready to go into a marathon plan.\n\nA marathon is much more than two half marathons though, so don’t get overconfident. Without good training, things can fall apart after 20 miles… \n\nMy other advice would be to not have any goal or no “reach” goal for your first marathon. Just focus on doing well and finishing and enjoy it. Once you’ve done one, you’ll want to do another. And you’ll have your bearings on how your body reacts and you can set a goal then.\n\nPhilly was my first marathon back in 2016.",

Shooting for 2:52 high or faster should be the goal.\n\nConsistency is key really.  Ramping to 65-70 mpw comfortably for 4-4.5 months sounds solid.  Get some solid long runs in, longer tempos 8-12 milers maybe, nice recovery runs.  Keep it all consistent and interesting and find some people to do it with.  The hardest part of a sub 3/2:52 marathon is keeping it in control in the beginning.  It may feel too slow and you might wanna rip but trust the splits and keep the pace where you need it to be early so you can finish strong and comfortable and at pace in the end.  Banking time is certainly a logic people have, but a marathon run at 6min pace for the first half and 6;45 for the back half is just as fast as splitting the difference throughout and you probably won't want to kill yourself at mile 22.  \n\nStrength training is great to keep uninjured and definitely fine tune your fueling plans.

My new plan was provided by Valencia Marathon so I don’t have it available to give you but it was a specific plan to break 4:00 and every run gave me a pace to run at . When I first started training , that pace was in the low end zone 4 and felt uncomfortable. By the end of the 16 weeks, it was a steady pace and didn’t feel nearly as hard . The plan didn’t focus on long runs . I did only a handful of long runs over 21kms and only once went up to 30kms. The plan had me doing two medium long runs back to back every weekend ( example: 18kms with 12kms at marathon pace followed by a 25 kms easy run the next day ). Overall my weekly mileage was the same from my previous marathon but it was just distributed differently. My speed work sessions with this plan were easier than I was use to ( 1km reps at a 5:10 pace with 90 second recovery of rest) x 10 plus warm up and cool down . With my previous marathon training ,  I was doing faster reps but less of them  This training plan also used a 2 week taper vs a 3 week taper . Overall , my training for the 3:57 marathon seemed easier and I didn’t feel fatigued. I finished strong in the marathon ( only got hard the last 5kms.l). Anyway ,I’m not suggesting this type of training might work for you but you might benefit from trying something totally different.",

And volume doesn’t need to be 50 miles per week or anything crazy for a sub 4 in my opinion. I just made sure I hit my long runs each week and then did a mid week run that was half my long run distance. I focused more on recovery this cycle than getting higher mileage so I only did 1 or 2 additional short runs each week. \n\nNutrition gets you by the last 6 mile bonk so all you have to fight is the mental aspect at the end because a marathon still is fucking hard especially when you are on your feet for 4 hours.",

I had terrible IT band issues at the time and it was incredibly disheartening to feel them coming on around mile 6. By mile 11, I was walking and in a lot of pain. Afterward, I questioned my relationship with running and my own body for at least a couple of months.  I didn't tell anyone my time or even want to talk about marathons with other people.  I was embarrassed by my time.\n\nI eventually got back in the saddle and started learning things. I have learned A LOT about myself and about running since then. I went all-in on half-marathon training and then marathon training. It hasn't been easy and there have been several frustrating injuries along the way, but the journey as a whole has been transformative. I eventually qualified for Boston with a 2:59 marathon and just ran NYC in 3:16.\n\nTake your R&R seriously over the next few weeks. Make your goals and a roadmap of how to reach them.  You've probably heard this before, but I'm going to repeat it because it's 1000% true.  You learn something important with every marathon you run.  Take that new found knowledge with you moving forward, stay focused, and I promise you'll kick ass.",

I finished!” But it feels dishonest because yes even though I finished something incredible, I knew I was capable of more.

Based on what you said the last 8-12 miles sounds like they were a huge struggle and you probably thought about quitting more than once, but you stuck it out.  That's an accomplishment to be proud of.\n\nThen, since it didn't go the way you wanted it to, learn from it.  If you crossed finish a marathon off your bucket list and don't plan to run another one, that's great, but if you want to try again give yourself an honest assessment.\n\nDid you put in the training you really needed to reach your goal?  Was your goal realistic?  (Both at the start of your training and on race day based on how training went).  By definition your race strategy didn't work so use 20/20 hindsight to reassess. One of the most challenging things about a marathon is to really be in tune with your body.  It's one thing to determine how your body feels while running.  It's really difficult to train yourself to understand how is my body going to feel in 18-20 miles if I keep this up?\n\nWhat specifically went wrong?  I'm going to guess that your legs died on you along with cramping.  Reconsider your hydration and nutrition strategy.\n\nFrom the sounds of it, you had an aggressive goal originally but couldn't put in the training you needed due to injury and then overestimated the reality of where you were on race day.  Also did you take the course and weather into account?  And then the frustrating thing about marathons is that sometimes you can do everything right and then just not have it on race day.\n\nI had a similar scenario for my most recent scenario.  I had goal when I started training.  My training didn't go particularly well due to a minor injury, life getting in the way, and if I'm honest some just plain laziness on my part.  I readjusted my goal significantly on race day and still missed that by quite a bit.  Looking back on the whole process I know what I did wrong and most frustratingly some of the mistakes I made were mistakes I had made before.\n\nIn the end, check the completed a marathon box, learn from the experience, and move on to the next with that knowledge if you desire to.",

First, I ran a marathon, something very few people will ever do and something I myself thought I would never do until I finished.

It might help for you to do 2 rounds of 15k and then just focus on the 15k you're running at the time, because you've probably done 15k loads of times and it won't sound daunting then.\n\nAnd remember: in a couple of weeks you'll be in the taper wishing you did more of those long runs because you feel so underprepared (which is just taper brain speaking). I was longing for a long long run just to remind me that my legs were fine, because during the taper they got so heavy I was doubting whether they had had any benefit from all my training 😂.\n\nGood luck with the last bits of your training and have fun in your marathon!",

Some strategies that help me when I'm not feeling it:\n\n- having a special audiobook I'm only allowed to listen to while on long runs \n- meeting my husband and kids for a nice breakfast at a cafe or garden centre at the end of the run\n- running half the distance, having a cafe and croissant, then running home (feels like only half the distance)\n- being dropped off / running home from a family outing so it feel like I'm 'just running home'\n- choosing a completely new trail / area to explore \n- doing a looped course so I don't have to carry much \n\nDon't forget to keep it easy - walking is fine, enjoy the scenery, take some pictures. \n\nAlso, if your long runs take you over 3 to 3.5 hours consider shortening them. Going over that time has very limited training benefits (other than testing gear and nutrition) but increases the risk of injury. I've run a 50 miler successfully without ever going over 3.5 hours in a single run).\n\nOh, one last thing: I think you mentioned struggling with your nutrition. It's worth experimenting with different types of gels, as well as liquid nutrition (such as Tailwind). Ideally that would happen much earlier than 4 weeks out but if you're not getting in enough carbs it could be worth a shot. I'd try to get at least 60g per hour if you can",

I’m pretty sure this was accumulated fatigue.\n\nSo don’t stress out, and don’t short yourself on the taper! Let the fatigue melt off and you’ll be ready for race day.\n\nAnd you won’t be by yourself on race day! You’ll be surrounded by loads of other runners! IMO, the energy of a race environment is like nothing else, and will provide an even bigger boost than what you get from running with your group.\n\nHave a great race! You got this!!!",

You almost certainly will not enjoy  jumping right back into training for a 2nd one. It takes most people 3 to 4 weeks to fully recover from a marathon and you will likely feel very run down those first weeks back.\n\n\nWhile I don't think you'll improve in 10 weeks I dont think you're doomed to be a 6 hour marathoner either. Looking at your volume I only see 4 weeks out of 27 where you managed the full marathon distance in an entire week. Your volume is too low to run a solid marathon. Weight lifting is helpful but can't replace running volume. \n\nYour fueling isnt why you had a bad race but it is on the very low end. There are recommendations for 30 to 90g and hour of carbs but it's something you train your gut towards and figure out in training what amount you feel best. I used to fuel similar to you and now I'm closer to 55g an hour.",

Do your daily easy runs, add some structure (fartlek or intervals or whatever) to help keep you focused and grind it out. You're so close now and most of the work is already done \n\n\nMaybe marathon running just isn't for you and that's ok, not worth beating yourself up over it.\n\n\nGenerally speaking, how is your mental health?

Going in without a plan never went super-well for me, so now I usually have one for halfs.  Not aways.  Halfs are a lark for me.  Marathons, not so much: full planning needed. \n\nThis June’s BQ attempt was the zenith of 21 weeks of training.  The event itself was not dramatic.  I turned my pre-launch plan to ‘on’ in my head and did my motions to the letter (hydrate, fuel, warmup).  Knew my lactate threshold ‘A’ pace, ‘B’ pace, and ‘C’ goal if it all went sideways.  And I had three pre-planned self-check points en route.\n\nAnxiety level: zero.  The moment I stepped off the grid I slowly warmed up.  My 'A' pace is comfortable but brisk.  I never got outside of tempo zone.  Ran a bit hot to checkpoint 1, then deliberately slowed to 'A' Goal.  Checked my time against my paceband and the course markers at each mile.  Stayed at 'A' pace at checkpoint 2 (halfway point of marathon).  Slowed slightly to 'B' pace at Checkpoint 3 (Mile 21) and ran the event to within 16 seconds of 'A' Goal.  Absent clear training goals practiced often, none of that would have been possible.  Marathons are extreme events, at least for me at this point, and failure to plan results in the marathon disaster stories found here and elsewhere.",

So more cross styling training might help you perform better on the track.\n\nAnother factor is that a lot of good track runners massively underperform in cross. It's a fantastic accomplishment to beat all these fast people but that doesn't automatically mean you have the ability to run their track times. It's not to say there's nothing you can do to close that gap on the track but rather that cross may simply be more your domain and it's still awesome to perform so well in that domain.\n\nI had a similar career where I was generally performing at a higher level in cross than in track, and my best cross races were way better than my best track races. I could never really figure out that rhythm required to run well on the track. There's plenty of things I could've done better but a lot of it is just different physical and mental skills.",

Things like your training log, knowledge of the women you're baselining yourself against, times in XC, etc.\n\nThat said, over the years I have trained with dozens of women just like you as they rolled out of college, and it's always the same few things. So I can probably surmise some decent guesses\n\n1) The college system doesn't mesh with the body's natural rhythm. All three seasons overlap, so you're trying to peak whilst also building a base for the next season. That creates burnout and hormone disruption, so you're most likely running cumulative fatigue from season to season. You nailed it, you are likely just spent by the time outdoor rolls around, but you're racing XC relatively fresh\n\n2) I don't know your XC times, but your 800 is fairly weak compared to the other times listed. You say you have good speed, but the times you listed don't indicate that. That could be a lot of things, but if someone told me these were their PRs without any other information I would guess that they were doing half marathon training, not track. \n\nAgain, there's a lot of questions I'd love to ask to get into it deeper, but it could be anything from race execution (are you running splits? On feel? Are you a rhythm runner? Trying to stay with other women you know?) genetics (maybe you're more strength and suited for longer distances and hills) or lack of speed development during track. Hell, maybe the other women are just awful at technical courses. But I do know that the vast majority of runners are totally burned out by the time they finish their program; even if they raced relatively well. When you're in it it's hard to see, but a lot of runners struggle with the college system and the coaches are rewarded for results, not doing what's best for their athletes.\n\nIt sounds like your collegiate career may be over or close to, but if not, I would sit down with the coach and request two things:\n\n1) a hard one week break between indoor and outdoor\n2) more dedicated speed work during track, even if it's at the cost of volume/strength work. If that means right now to finish out the season, I would drop the volume and start ripping 200s with standing recovery\n\nBest of luck to you.

But brilliant to still be able to achieve a milestone time like sub-3!\n\nAs it turns out you ran 4 seconds faster than I did for my first 'real' marathon, coming at it with what sounds like a similar training base, work/family situation and body weight. I didn't have the same GI issues you did, but severe cramps in the last few miles pulled me up short and saw sub-3 evaporate within the space of a quarter hour.\n\nJust missing the mark served as huge motivation for me though, and my next attempt (six months later, at age 44) was 2:52. Then 2:45, 2:51 (similarly hot day) and now 2:43 with aspirations of going sub-2:40 before age wins the day.\n\nThe key to this has been consistent mileage and consistent sessions, including marathon pace efforts in long-runs. I signed up with a coach which has been good, and run occasionally with a group, although still mostly pre-dawn and alone given demands of kids etc.\n\nFrom what you've outlined I don't think you need to increase mileage particularly, just keep the consistency and make sure you have a couple of solid sessions plus a long run each week where you can see gradual month to month gains. \n\nI personally wouldn't worry about dieting (I'm exactly your 183lbs at 6\"; I fluctuate a bit in and out of heavy training blocks, but the couple of times I have tried to deliberately drop weight it's led to poor mood, poor sleep, bouts of sickness (maybe coincidental but still) and increase in niggles. I'm sure there'd be some benefit, but it hasn't stopped me getting faster to this point. \n\nI also wouldn't worry too much about the nutrition plan - as a heavier runner you burn more calories anyway, and if you're taking 2-3 gels & decent amount of fluid every hour (and as long as you've practiced something similar) you're likely to be fine. From what I understand, for most people bonking during a marathon is much more about muscle fatigue caused by going just a bit too hard (even 3-5s/mile) for a sustained period than the margins of a fuelling plan. \n\nGood luck and hope you smash through that 2:50 mark soon!",

So keep doing that. \n\nYou need long runs.  As others pointed out you’re essentially hitting the wall now at 17. You pushed to the end in this one to 20 but in a marathon if anyone hits the wall (usually 17-18 miles) they could keep it up if only going to 20 but then there’s another 10k and we usually say “that’s where the marathon BEGINS”. \n\nYour fueling seems quite off. Did you only eat a few gummy things during that whole 20 miles?  I know ONE fast marathoner who eats just a jellybean each mile (honestly) and she’s running Boston soon by BQ so she’s fast - but she’s the only one I’ve ever met who does this. Others are eating gels every 25-35 minutes.  You’ll typically need more fuel to get through 26.2 so work on that to help avoid that bonk at 17-18 miles too. \n\nRevel is downhill so that could work for you. Knowing downhills beat up the legs in a different way, many of my friends say it’s not so bad in revel races since there’s no uphill later so maybe that will work for you. I’ve friends who say they shave 10-13 minutes off already fast marathons when at the Revel downhill once so that’s the silver lining I’d focus on if I were you. \n\nAnd if you hit 3:15 or something- that’s still excellent and you’ll know how to work toward that inevitable sub 3 in the near future. So keep at it and most importantly come back after that May race and give us the download on how it went!  \n\nRooting for your sub 3 whether it’s May or a bit later!",

The second half was a lot tougher for me too.

You probably have overtrained yourself. Consider only doing two of those at week 6 and week 4 for your peak weeks, and start ramping down and tapering after that.\n\nAnother aspect is you probably should have adjusted your pacing according to your HR. i.e. if you expect your HR on MP is \\~160, exceeding 165 for a long period of time for the first half is a bad sign. You might feel better off if you slow down a bit.\n\n\n\nGood luck on your next race, and I hope you have learned your lessons from this one. Given that Boston raised the bar this year, the cutoff should be way smaller than last year. If your BQ line is 3:00, I personally think 256 is good enough. So maybe you do not need to pace too aggressively. With some minor adjustment on training intensity and pacing strategy, you would definitely do well next time. Keep healthy and keep fit!",

You should be comparing yourself to your past self, and feel proud of having made some progress throughout the years.\n\nComparing yourself to others is pointless. Your HM time puts you approximately in the top 15% of the people running the Paris HM, but so what?

This is a self-defeating goal. You might achieve that one day, and if you do, you'll feel hapy about it, sure, but _you cannot train daily by that thought._ It makes no sense at all.\n\nIn my view, this mindset is 200% incompatible with running for mental health benefits, since you mention it. You need a completely different effort-reward approach.

Change your mindset to something more positive that brings more daily satisfaction and less anxiety. You need to be far more relaxed about your running, as some of your other comments also clearly indicate. You will actually need that to gain true speed.\n2. Run your easy jogs slower. I don't get how you're running 400s at 1:16+ and easy-jogging at 5:10/km. I know female elites who do their jogs at that pace. Try 400s at 1:12 and easy jogs at 5:25-5:30.\n3. I'm personally not at all convinced by a stable 6-to-7-days-a-week plan for someone who's primarily trying to gain speed. Have one compulsory rest day, and rest means nothing, nada, not even stretching. Experiment with harder speedwork (e.g. tempo in your long run) and two rest days (e.g. Monday and Friday).\n4.

You start to gain perspective-no one really cares how you do except yourself, it's all for fun, so just enjoy it! Races are a celebration of the training you've done! \n\nI have won a couple races and won age group awards, but the biggest takeaways I get from racing are the boosts in training from doing those races, and learning about how I personally can race well (nutrition, routine, sleep, taper, etc.)  I'd rather have a PR than win a race. Ultimately how I place depends on how good the competition is, and it's easier to run fast if I'm chasing other people.",

                    "body": "Running faster over shorter distances gets harder as we age, maybe that's more anecdotal but it definitely requires more work.\n\nTo run faster over shorter distances requires faster workouts, faster training runs, maybe a mix of volume based workouts 10x 1k or 20x400 on shorter rest but a slower avg pace as well as some faster turnover workouts.\n\nBeing in your thirties and wanting to run fast doesn't make you delusional but if you don't do the recovery work, you'll definitely notice it sooner than if you were a young'n.  \n\nFor your training, I think your times are fine.  Ultimately running is about consistency.  It's better to run 6 months at 70 km's a month than 2-3 at 100 and then be injured or too tired for a month and then come back and try to jump in again.  \n\nBut the questions I have for you is if you ever increase your kilometerage over time and what exactly it is you're training for?  What are you goal races and distances?  Are you just working with a coach for the hell of it?  It could be easier to say, \"I want to run the XYZ Marathon this fall and that is 9 months away.\" And then proceed to tailor your training to that.  What will your training look like now with that coach?  What races will you pick to help gauge your fitness along the way and what purpose will they serve to your training?  Will you increase the distance of your tempos/fartleks or drop the pace of your track workouts/tempos or increase your daily and weekly and monthly kilometers over that 9 month period and how will you keep honest to that commitment without going out too hard at the start of the block?  Your training seems like it lacks focus or clear intent as to your race plans.  Why are you doing the specific workouts you listed above?  Are there any plans to run more kilometers in a week or a month?  Are you looking to run a fast half or full marathon or a fast 5k/10k?  Sometimes it can be hard to expect everything in one season or build.\n\nRunning is like weight lifting.  You will only improve to the amount of weight you lift.  If may be hard at first but eventually you'll get used to it and be lifting the same amount of weight for years and you won't get stronger.  Stagnation in running can occur if you never change anything (pace, distance, workouts, strength work, diet, sleep, etc).  Maybe you can talk to your coach and run through something very basic to start.  Increase the weekly mileage by 5/8/10kms and see how that feels. Maybe instead of a full day off, just another 5-6km shakeout run and then a long lift.  Or even a cross train day (bike swim). Or don't increase distance and run a training run faster.  Not killing yourself,  but faster gradually and see how you feel doing that for a few weeks.  Unless you're really new to running, you likely won't get anywhere by never adding or changing anything once your body is used to it.  There's definitely room for you to get faster and that seems far more likely once you have a clear goal in mind.  Honestly 70km weeks feels like something on the low side for a half marathon build.  I'd be curious how you'd feel bumping it up to 100km weeks at the max.  Not that much of a time commitment, great base mileage for most races from 5k-Half and isn't too much of a jump from where you are at.  I also don't think your workouts will be terribly impacted by the jump.  Just ease into it slowly over time and pretty soon youll be hitting 100k's a week feeling like you must not have done enough because you still feel good.\n\n\nParadoxically, I think the better you get at running the less you should expect to win.  At least for me, that's how I see it.  If I am in shape to race faster, perform better, whatever then I would typically be looking to jump into a road race that is full of fast people. A lot of the time, I am not trying to win races, I am trying to run my best time.  It's you against the clock.  Now you can obviously still have goals to win a race if that matters, maybe there's a prize or something involved you wouldn't mind having, but ultimately the prize would have to be pretty good to justify the time spent winning the race vs not going for a personal goal.  Now if I end up coming close to winning or winning the race as a result, that's amazing, but I never want to look back and think about how I could have run a faster time because I decided I'd rather jump into a local, empty 5k for a win rather than a race that could have actualized my months of training into a performance goal I had.\n\nI've been running for nearly 2 decades now and have had some catastrophic injuries.  When I finally got back to racing in 2023, I noticed I was still a bit scared/holding back.  I was a bit nervous about my fitness and my race sense and had convinced myself I'd never get back to where I was before and to stop self sabotaging by going out too fast.  Then after one race I very clearly noticed I was holding back AND I looked at all my workouts and was like \"wait a minute...\" So at the next race I decided to full send it and test my actual fitness at that point in time, not what my anxiety told me MIGHT happen.  And I legitimately had one of the best seasons I had since my collegiate years AND I was 30 when I did it.  Sometimes, you gotta trust everything even if you can't trust yourself.  Your coach, your training, your teammates.  That stuff is all tangible.  Sometimes you really just need to full send it in a race to test where you're at and embrace the pain.  Otherwise, you can also have the best build, the best coach, the best preparation, all of that, and still never get better",

I definitely haven't felt like the taper/recovery has significantly affected my training.\n\nMy read of this experience is that Pfitz has so many mid-length+ runs (at this point 4 runs over 14 miles most weeks since I'm doing it on 6 days/week) that it makes the half distance feel very comfortable and ordinary.

Obviously, it's still going to get very, very hard at the end, but it's just a more forgiving race than a 5K or full marathon. \n\n>I already signed up for a local halfmarathon in Taichung in 16 weeks. I will be using Pfitz's 31-47 HM programme, I hope it's not too much of a mileage jump. I think that 1:25 is a reasonable goal, because I started too far back during this race, it wasn't a flat race and I left a lot in the tank. Hopefully, getting some carbon plated shoes will also yield benefits.

Again this is another mental thing because I thought it would be Chicago flat. When the sun hits at around 25k I knew goal time was over because the calf just started to feel a bit cramp which forced me to do damage control and slow down a bit (the hard number is cadence dropping). I am still happy because due to injury my main goal was just to finish and not worsen my health and I didn’t give up and walk, although slowly jogging at the last km. Just embrace whatever results and be grateful that you can run Tokyo marathon because not everyone has the opportunity. You will feel a lot better.",

Do you have additional life stress outside of running that can be affecting you? Are you looking forward to runs/races? My guess is you could use a down week or two of easy running to mentally reset. But some other possibilities:\n\nYou said your 5k PB was last year - was that 3 months ago or 12 months ago?  If it wasn’t recent, I would race another 5k when you can and confirm your fitness. For me, if I haven’t raced a 5k recently, the first one is usually pretty rough. It takes me a couple attempts of pushing into the 5k pain cave to desensitize myself to that uncomfortable feeling. So if you went out a bit fast relying on an old PB, and weren’t acclimated to the 5k suffering, maybe that led to you pulling the plug early. \n\nAlso, I wouldn’t be so reliant on measuring your fitness from workouts. Remember each workout has a purpose, and seldomly is that purpose to measure fitness. That’s what racing is for. If you are racing your workouts perpetually, that can lead to the mental burnout I mentioned earlier. \n\nFinally, it could just be a bad race. Bad races happen, maybe you have an underlying illness, maybe your hormones were off for some reason, who knows. Some days just aren’t our days. Don’t dwell on single bad races.

You know the right things to do, you know that you're not at your best at the moment, and you can just follow the steps to get back to where you want to be. There won't be any shortcuts in any case. Just get back into the training, handle the workload that feels feasible for now (don't overreach!) and you'll get the result you get at the marathon. \n\nAlso, remember that finishing a marathon is *always* an accomplishment. If you're not in great shape for it and run a 3:20, that's completely fine. No one's going to look down on you for it, the disappointment or joy is all in your head. Get ready, lace them up, and enjoy Paris.\n\nEdit - I forgot that I *also* had a little respiratory bug in late October that I felt healed from but still had some chest congestion at race time.

My mind had plenty of other stuff to do so hunger was on the back burner the whole summer and I lost way too much weight. The weight just fell off. I had struggled with body dysmorphia so I didn’t know how bad it had gotten until I look back now. \n\nBeing so light, I was just running a lot faster. My running fitness was amazing, and I felt fine. I thought it was just my new normal…despite not having my period since July 2023. I was losing so much hair in the shower. Digestive system was a disaster. Not to mention I looked like garbage. I was in denial. \n\nBeing in denial, I started a marathon training block in June 2024 and continued improving until September. During my marathon training block, with the increased intensity and frequency of runs, my body was finally over letting me get away with underfuelling. I would often just be okay underfueled all week then all of a sudden crash and be starving near the end of the week and eat a ton. Was not a great pattern for training, but it was the start of getting my appetite back. My body then lowkey quit on me September-October 2024 (my marathon was in October) as it just couldn’t keep up with the training and all the under fueling caught up to me badly and so I ended up gaining a huge appetite, an uncomfortable amount of weight, and just dropping some runs at the end. I also all of a sudden needed 2 hours more sleep per night than usual. Marathon still went well but I was not feeling my best physically or mentally. \n\nOn the bright side of that, I got my period back almost immediately after my marathon. I gently introduced running back into my routine, my appetite regulated itself again, and I felt like a spark that I had been missing returned to myself. I pushed my focus back to lifting to regain the muscle I’d lost in the weight loss and help me have a balanced approach, and I’ve been a lot better about resting, fueling, and running smartly since then. My muscle gain has been strong (used to be much buffer a couple years ago so gain was quicker) and I feel strong. I took a bit of time off running this December-January due to illness and injury, which was much needed. Sleep is also back to normal numbers and appetite has balanced out. \n\nSo really, I did not ever quit exercise during RED-S recovery at all. I just gained the appetite and weight back (albeit too quickly) and rested more. It sucked to gain weight so quickly just from a physical comfortability standpoint but my body was in disarray after being underfuelled for so long and taking a beating with the intense training load that it was at a breaking point. My recovery journey is probably not the most medically recommended, but it has worked so far, and I feel much stronger than before, even if I am slower. I also feel very lucky to not have suffered a massive injury…besides my shin splints which are still irritating me a bit.",

For example, for most people, it isn't too hard to complete 2hrs under most conditions without fuel or water, if you are doing long slow distance.  However, if you are racing a marathon in 3-5hrs, you will almost certainly hit the wall as you run low on water needed to burn whatever glycogen you have left, or you just flat out run out of glycogen to burn.\n\nNote that for very well trained, efficient runners with years of experience, they may still not hit the wall without fuel/hydration, but they certainly could go faster with.

Nowadays I do about 19 miles long runs each week, half of them fasted, typically finishing with some faster pace (for example 6x1k @ 10k pace with plenty of recovery).\n\nPlease, understand when I say \"fasted\" I don't mean \"calorie deficit\". I maintain my weight and I eat every day. I also always eat right after any workout and I refrain from doing workouts if I was unable to eat right afterwards. For example I don't do workouts in the evening because I would have to eat right before my bed time and I think it makes no sense to do a workout only to have a poor night of sleep.\n\nThe way I notice lack of carbs is that after some time on my legs, my legs just don't want to go any faster. The time it takes to get to this point depends on whether I started in fasted state.\n\nMy mental model is that there is a reserve of glycogen available, and that reserve depends on whether I have been eating recently. When the reserve gets depleted, I can still get energy but now two things happen. My brain really doesn't want to run out of glycogen so it will prevent muscles from going hard before the glycogen runs out. And there is energy available from fats but it is only available at slow pace so you can't run as fast on it.\n\nFor example, if I do my long run fed, I have no problem hitting even much faster than 5k pace even after 20 miles. But if this is in fasted state, it seems frequently even just after 10 miles I have trouble hitting anything faster than 10k pace. My legs just can't be mobilised to move any faster.\n\nFor this reason I constantly switch between running in fasted and fed state:\n\n\\* fasted: easy runs, about half of my long runs with some moderate pace at the end (up to 10k)\n\n\\* fed: all workouts, about half of my long runs, especially when testing my race pace or when including a very substantial amount of marathon and faster pace or when I include 5k pace or faster in the workout.\n\nI want also to point out that runs at easy pace are not different from fed runs.

If you haven't put in the time building up your legs to running that kind of mileage at that *specific* pace, the altitude benefit will be much smaller. ",

Make sure you are eating enough (of the right things). This was a problem for me as at times I would feel tired and lethargic and it was because I was not eating enough. During peak marathon training with 60 and 70 mile weeks this meant things like a protein shake with a scoop of ice cream in it to make sure I was getting enough calories.\n\n  \nMentally it felt great, if it feels overwhelming that could be your body telling you to back off for a bit.\n\n  \nIf you are eating appropriately mood and energy should be great!\n\n  \nCan't speak to if benefits plateaued or diminished yet. Generally speaking I find that keeping a certain volume of mileage over time you will get faster (provided you are doing workouts and training right), however for a step change improvement that usually requires an uptick in mileage.\n\n  \nOnly surprise is how crazy non runners think you are!",

So the 20% of \"hard\" miles now give me lots of options for intervals, tempos and long run fartleks. Running builds very little muscle, so I still look very average lol. And recovery times do get shorter - I can run 6 days/week easily; at <30mpw I could not.\n\nQ2 & Q3. 50mpw is the limit for me as a single guy with a corporate 9-6 job + an ok social life. If I go beyond 50 I feel like my entire life is work and running, which is bad for my mental state. Fine for a marathon block, but not sustainable unless I get fast enough to run more miles in the same amount of time. This is an important point that beginners/slower runners overlook. Some people who run 70+ miles are so fast that time-on-feet is similar to a newbie's 40 mile weeks.\n\n Q4. I've been at around 45mpw for a while and cycle between periods of plateau and increase in fitness. IMO the milage is enough to improve continuously - you just have to make sure you're pushing your limits each week. My plateaus were in periods of travel and more partying/drinking, which is a reasonable tradeoff. \n\nQ5. Weight gain. I find it easy to eat enough calories at 50mpw - you can eat back a 10 mile run in a few chocolate bars.

The biggest challenge is balancing work (a demanding managerial job), family (two young children), house maintenance, friends, etc.\n\nPhysically, I recommend being flexible during the off-season to listen to your body and prevent injuries, but things go pretty well once the body gets used to it and the volume gradually increases.

It also had a tremendous negative impact on my overall strength levels and muscle mass which may not be that important to you. \n\nI took a full year to build from 40 to 60mpw with no racing - just building base and tempo runs to mix things up. I became a better runner in literally every aspect. Smoother, faster, speed work yielded greater benefits, etc. I ran a sub-3:00 marathon. Because I took a long time to build, I remained injury free, and I lost weight down to 155lbs. My mental state didn’t change much, but runs of a certain length just became not that big of a deal and I became a lot more zen about it. I run exclusively without music, too, and I enjoyed the time to disconnect. \n\nAs an example: At 155lbs and around 13% bodyfat I could squat 250 for heavy triples. At 175 and around 15-16% bodyfat, I currently squat 315 for triples to 5s depending on the session. My bench and deadlift numbers are also, obviously, higher now. The combination of mileage and muscular adaptations specifically for running made it very difficult to channel the same CNS activation necessary for my top end strength.

I kept my general mileage at an easy to moderate pace and emphasized my workouts, including the long run every Saturday. In all, it probably took about 3 months to fully adapt and start to reap the rewards. That was when holding faster paces and longer efforts really got easier, and I was able to step it up further in workouts and eventually in races.\n\nTo answer your specific questions, I noticed my body became more adapted to running of all types. I took longer to feel fatigued during workouts and felt stronger overall. Sometimes it was like walking a tightrope in terms of being very fit vs being tired from the workload, but in retrospect I think that’s more because I had a bad habit of pushing the occasional easy mileage run too hard. No point in dropping 6:30’s mid-run on a Wednesday when you have intervals waiting for you on Thursday. Mentally I can’t say that there was much change apart from having to reset what I thought I was capable of. My mood or energy level didn’t change much either. If you eat right, get lots of sleep, find some soft surfaces to run on occasionally, and generally just take care of your body, you should be able to manage it just fine. \n\nI’m not sure I understand what you’re asking in reference to plateauing/diminishing benefits- as I see it, training volume is one of the determinant factors for a person’s fitness. In a single season/build up, your body will adapt to increased mileage in the sense that in response to that stimuli, your body will adapt- it will learn to intake and absorb more oxygen, your heart’s strength will increase, and your body will get better at managing the creation and disposal of lactic acid. Whatever level you can reach on 50 miles per week should be fairly steady. Your body will not adapt to that mileage and then say that you need to increase your volume to maintain your current fitness level. You can tweak a few other factors like training intensity or diet but those aren’t going to have as large an effect as changes to your training volume will. If nothing else, maintaining 50 miles per week you’re still stacking good weeks on good weeks, which should further your fitness- or at least maintain it.\n\nAs for surprises, what really stood out to me was that after the fact, it became obvious that most runners are aerobically underdeveloped- and that the aerobic base is probably the most important aspect of fitness for ~90%~ of all runners. For the overwhelming majority of athletes, if you can increase your training volume, good adaptions will follow.\n\nMy coach always has us think of fitness as a pyramid in which the mileage/volume determines the size of the base. The larger the base of the pyramid, the higher the peak can be. \n\nHope this helped, good luck this season! Winter is a good time to start new and build.",

A couple points/questions there:\n\nFirst, point taken on the fuck no/fuck yes dichotomy; I wish I'd had this attitude in the past. In the best shape of my life (the aforementioned 20 week block), I failed to realize the \"meh\" attitude I had going into the race, as I'd already qualified for Boston 2024 that May and this was my second back-to-back cycle. I got burnt out towards the end, my training dipped slightly, and I ran the race unintelligently, and massively underperformed (2:46:24 with a goal of sub 2:38:00). Follow that up with an unenthusiastic (and wildly inconsistent) third cycle for Boston 2024 (that's 15 out of 18 months spent in marathon training) and you get complete disaster on race day, where it was a fuck no and I went out there anyway. What resulted threw my mental so hard that I didn't start consistently training again until now, under 90 days out from Boston 2025.\n\nNext, I'm baffled by your 5k race times given the apparent lack of speedwork. To again compare to my Summer 2023 training, to be in that shape at that time I was running around 4 miles of intervals (usually broken up into pieces anywhere between 800m and 1600m) every week at sub 5:00 pace. I didn't race a 5k around then, though I'd like to think under 16 minutes would have been doable. How on earth did you run a 15:28 5k when it doesn't look like track intervals were at all a focus? Had you done a lot of speedwork in the previous cycle that had been cut short?\n\nLast question is about weekly mileage. I'm noticing that you started pretty high (above 60mpw), and peaked at just over 77. Did you start where you did simply because you were fresh off of a different training block, or would you normally work up to that kind of mileage before starting a training plan anyway? I try to start my cycles running 45mpw, but maybe starting at 60 would be a good idea, to decrease the week-week gains? Hard not to feel like building to that mileage \\*before\\* the cycle even starts is simply making the cycle longer. Apart from the norovirus-inflicted \\~51mi week, where are your drop weeks? Where's your taper? Do you usually not do either?\n\nThanks in advance. I haven't yet managed a completely consistent 20 week cycle, so while I fully believe you when you say consistency is everything, I'd rather not have to take your word for it. There are some potentially really fast races to be had if I don't.",

The Pfitz long runs (when they don’t have explicit MP) has you progressively get down to MP+10%, effectively giving you a sub threshold session on tired legs. Do you feel like the interval paced session gave you something extra? Do you feel like you were missing out on “run fast on tired legs” that is a big feature of the Pfitz plans?",

Also living on the gulf coast, it blows my mind (if I understand correctly) that you don't take any fluids with you on summer long runs. It sounds dangerous, to be honest. Have you ever done a sweat test to see how much you sweat?\n\nOn not fueling, did you not fuel during the marathon and/or practice in training at all?

I read Pfitz and JD’s books, built plans, signed up for races, and followed through with my personal commitments.\n\nMilestones: Ran 2050 miles, which was 2x more than I had ever run before. I raced 1 5k, 1 10k, 3 HM, and 1 FM. Set PRs in them all, including shaving 25 min off my HM PB and 65 min off my FM PB. My HM progression was huge. Previous PR was 1:48. I ran a 1:37 in April, 1:30 in June, and 1:25 in October. Felt amazing in the last race and got really comfortable with the distance.\n\nMy primary reflection is that consistency is king. This includes not only running, but strength, recovery, sleep, fueling, etc. I didn’t have any major injuries and I ran 5-6x per week all year. This was huge for my performance, plus my physical and mental health. \n\nMy secondary reflection is that race performance takes practice. I got substantially better at the HM by training for 4 over the course of 12 months. It’s important to learn how the race will feel at various points.\n\nMy primary 2025 goal is to run 2300 annual miles. My secondary goal is to improve on my marathon performance. I ran 3:11 at CIM, but had a rough finish. My training, fueling, hydration, pacing, and heart rate tracking all need more experience. I plan to run a FM in April and one in September, with the goal of finishing strong and hopefully hitting sub 3 this fall.\n\nMy last goal is to run in more beautiful places. I’ve come to love road racing, but I miss trail running in the mountains. In the summer, I’ll take some of my long runs on the trails.

All of my running years before that were at ~1000-2000 km yearly totals with no real focus on the proper training but just racing; the mindless circles of \"breaking and fixing\" @middle distances (up to 21k), tons of XC and a sporadic marathon (3 so far). \n\nThis year = 4640km (2880 miles) @ 400h of running, a good 85% of that was easy/z2 running. Average turns out 90kmpw / 55mpw. Raced 2 x 5k, 2 x 10k and 2 x HM, all decently close to PB's, which is due to me paying more attention to the Quality workouts, ie. I started doing a good race specific sessions 2-4 weeks before the race, some smarter tappering, less junkfood, better sleep managment/planning, etc.\n\nI was running ~355 days this year, the days off were all due due to the sickness and 1-2 days due to work. I work as a teacher so I pick all kinds of patogens in the classroom when I am overtraining. This year I had two onsets of 4-5 weeks of \"weak\" running @sickness, used 3 or 4 full antibiotic therapy (Penicillin FTW!). Summer was great thou, but scorching hot. I really enjoyed the variety of maxVO2 sessions at 30+ °C and one crazy crazy nightly road race 10k at 31°C and high humidity -- finished 37:59 but had to be laying on the ground for 10 minutes after the race while random people were pouring cold water on my head lol. \n\nMacrostructure of training = 5 days of easy running, 2 days of Quality. 50% of quality @ threshold, 30% @maxVo2, 20% @ race specifics. Most of the workouts at 400m - 2500m intervals with 70-120 seconds rest/walk/shuffle/float, depending on the goal of the workout. Longest run = 25km, and the average weekly LR/easy around 18-20k. No \"blocks\", just a ocassional adjustment to the race 2-4 weeks before it.\n\nNo injuries. No gym. No stretching. Just squats and lunges every other day or so. Yearly BMI floating betwen 24.3 and 25. Currently 25, need to start consciously eating less (aka skipping meals) again, because ~8 hour of running per week apparently doesn't do jack in that regard. :P I am big proponent of intermittent fasting - the concept was doing wonders for me before, ie. when my BMI was a freakin' 28-29 around 5 years ago.\n\nRunning wise, everything works for me, I really don't want to change much. I have a strong opinion about marathons and won't be doing any of that any time soon, unless I really master the fueling. My ultimate goal is to break a 80 minute HM, which might not even happen ever (83min PB ATM) since I am old and at the top of my \"genetics\" potential, but.. will be fun to see what the future brings. :)\n\nNext year I plan to do at least 1 race in the other country and bring my 9yo son with me to show him that you can't break the body by running (fast).",

Anything is better than nothing.\n- Breaking 20 in the 5K again would be nice\n- Have a good, injury-free half or full training block (still undecided)",

So, 5ks on the road and in cross country have always been quite the mental battle for me, but breaking them into distinct parts I feel always makes them manageable.\n\nThe first time I ran a track 5000 in college on the other hand, convinced me that running 12 &1/2 laps on the track is one of the most painful things you can ever subject yourself to. I still don't know why I do it.\n\nThe entire field went out rather conservatively for our fitness and we sort of just progressively picked up the pace with every lap, but not even quite halfway through (about 2.4k) I already felt like there was no way I was going to be able to keep this up. Every lap then on felt like a struggle of just trying to desperately hang on to the guy in front of me, but as the race continued I mentally urged myself to consciously surge every \\~200 meters to try and pass someone, edging closer to the leaders coming from the middle of the chase pack. I figured that if I were going to die, I'd rather at least do so trying to push a bit instead of likely dying a pathetic death anyway while fading out slowly.\n\nWith 1k to go, the excruciating oxygen debt was making me reconsider all my of choices, and it became incredibly tempting to just coast it in rather than pushing for the fastest possible time. Actually, at this point I was hating myself for ever choosing to be a distance runner. But I cross the line with 2 laps to go, and my coach yells that I'm on pace to go under 15:40! which gives me a second wind.\n\nI muster a kick of sorts, reach 400m to go, realize that I may have gone too early and start to fizzle out, give in mentally a bit, until I see my teammate about \\~20m ahead (who had been leading the race prior) also finally dying and realize I have a chance to beat him. I manage to recollect myself, dig in and find a second kick flailing arms all over to hit the line in 15:36, collapsing onto the track and hyperventilating for the next 10 minutes shortly thereafter.\n\nI think the only time I can say I ever pushed myself harder in a race than that was my last track meet in high school where I ran 4:35 in the mile and blanked out to the point that I don't remember anything, not the splits, or even how the race itself developed. It was quite literally a blur where the gun went off, we all settle in, and then suddenly I wake up at the homestretch. I couldn't speak properly for the next 30 minutes after finishing and knew then with certainty that I'd gotten 100% out of my body.",

When the going gets tough, most people quit, because it's hard and hurts. Knowing you can keep pushing through for X much longer or \"I've done this training, I can do this\" helps.\n\nAlso, some days just aren't your day. Can't PR on command for any number of reasons.

Even at the end of 400m repeats it's a challenge.\n\nThat said, I broke 20min twice this year with a similar finish time, but vastly different experiences. As others said, some days you're flying, others it's just not going to happen. You stressed your body by pushing harder than before, it will adapt.

After a few months 5k will be a breeze and just a matter in improving your speed. That’ll help pushing those last 1/2kms as well.\n\nSecond is do interval training. There soo many different types. Personal I do an 8k interval session. 1km warmup then 500m very hard followed by 500m super easy. Your 500 time should be 10-15% quicker then your 5km pace. So aim for 3:30s. Fairly common to do 400/500/1k intervals \n\nNot sure where you live but Parkrun is a great free event that lets you run with others giving that mental motivation to push that bit harder\n\nEdit: should also add as much as 5kms is a distance your pushing hard you still need to pace yourself, know your body. That’s where the long runs and intervals will help you learn how your body responds.\n\nI usually go hard the first km then easy off the middle 3 and then give it everything for the last km- you just need to learn what works for you",

I agree the taper is mentally challenging, no doubt, and yes you *feel* like you’re losing fitness - but that’s just how you feel is my understanding.  The goal is to finally allow your body to recover and reduce intensity greatly as it takes 2-3 weeks to see any gains from stimulus and work beyond the smidgen required to keep pop in your legs is a complete waste of time / counterproductive to aforementioned goal.  I think you made a mistake running 3 miles 40 secs faster than MP + blasting a 400 on race week…suggest more easy miles a la Pfitz taper.  Also maybe consider doing your most rigorous long run 4 weeks out and an easy 22 miler with max 3 @ MP 3 weeks out to avoid going so hard you are still recovering race day.",

However on the bike I can’t put the power down the same way and aim to keep the ball of my foot flat on the pedal.

But because that setback was so huge, only now (4.5 years later) am I finally at a point where I feel like \"ok--I'm really going to try to get back into this again.\"\n\nThe story: Got a freak injury in late Jan 2020 (not a running injury, but because it was a knee injury it *prevented* me from running). Turns out it also prevented me from lifting, cycling, ellipticaling, swimming breast stroke, walking more than two miles, going down stairs like a normal person (had to go down one stair at a time), and going up even the smallest incline/decline. Theoretically I could have swam other strokes, but pools were (reasonably) closed due to COVID, so that also ended up not really being an option.\n\nAlso because of COVID, it took forever to ID the diagnosis (multiple acute \"chondral defects\"), and then took forever to get into surgery for the repair. It was a two-part surgery (Oct and late December 2020) where they first had to go in, clean things up, and take a sample of some healthy cartilage. Then they had to culture that cartilage in a lab for 8ish weeks. Then they had to re-implant it. Surgery recovery was *monstrous*\\--afterwards I even ended up in the ER twice due to some surgical complications unrelated to the actual surgery site (organ stuff). Also for like 3 months after surgery I had to spend 4-6 hours per day [in a machine like this](https://i0.wp.com/post.medicalnewstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/GettyImages-1086825884_header-1024x575.jpg?w=1155&h=1528), which helped improve bloodflow while avoiding any weightbearing. That said, mentally it was torture.\n\nI think I got approved for walk-jogging in Summer 2021 (so \\~1.5 years from the initial time of injury). But the build was unimaginably slow. Also, my muscles (especially the quad on the leg that had sustained the injury) was **so atrophied**. I'd been pretty much unable to use my quad literally like, *at all* for 10 months, then I had two surgeries that shut it down. I lost I think all sense of brain-muscle connection to what is theoretically supposed to be the strongest muscle in my body. I still don't think I have it back. By Fall 2021 I was able to do some continuous running and by Jan 2022 (so 2 years from the time of injury) I was able to run like, 10-15 miles/week.\n\nUnfortunately because I got so weak during all of that time where I pretty much couldn't use my quads, I've become extremely clumsy. I've fallen and broken an arm, fallen and sprained an ankle, and fallen several times just busting up soft tissue (bruising, bleeding, etc.) that I've had to take time off for things like that pretty regularly. I've also just had general life challenges (harder to commit to training hard when you know you're so far off where you used to be), gotten sick, etc., all contributing to the inability to be consistent for more than 4 years since getting injured.\n\nHow did I handle things mentally? Terribly. I needed therapy, anti-depression meds. I would still just sit there and start crying. Frankly in retrospect there were probably a few times I should have gone to the hospital for the mental health side-effects of my injury--it was unimaginable and I was *not ok*.\n\nBUT: Finally, after all these years, I am feeling hopeful, excited, and able to be consistent about training. I'm going to need to rely a lot on the treadmill in the winter because of my weaknesses (more likely to fall in the dark/snow/ice), and I'm going to need to do a lot of strength stuff. But I'm registered for a June marathon and for the first time in a long time I'm excited to see what I can do. I won't PR and that's ok, but I know I can still run a time I'll be proud of, and I know I can still push myself. I just hope I can get through without any more setbacks. For the past several months my mileage situation has been like, a few consistent high 20s/low 30s weeks, then something happens so I have a 0-10 mile week or two, then I try to build back up again. Since I'm finally feeling like I can do this, my hope is to build up to regular 35-40 miles/week by late Dec/early Jan of this year so I can safety build up to a 55ish mile peak for June 2025 marathon training.",

My left ankle was shattered and my back was broken in three places. Between that accident and 2017 I had 15 surgeries including having my right knee replaced (it burned out because of doing all the work for my left leg all that time) and having a heart valve replaced.  The most significant of these, though, was having my left ankle fused. It never really healed previously and the damage was so profound the only option was to essentially remove my ankle joint and fuse everything together.\n\nDespite all of the physical issues I had the most difficult problem to get past was having lost my sense of being an athlete. It burned away at me in a way I can't really describe. At one point when I was out walking I started to play with jogging a few steps to see if I could find a way to have some kind of stride in order to run. As time went by I was able to put more and more jogging steps together to the point where I ran the Cambridge half marathon in 2017. Not fast, I was just outside the cut off time when they close things up, but I finished it. Now in the back of my mind I'm wondering if I can finish a marathon and qualify for Boston. As an adaptive runner that qualifying time is six hours, a very long time to be out there with a stride that is anything but pretty.\n\n2018 I chose the St. George's marathon as my qualifying attempt. It's mostly downhill which favors my fused ankle. I missed the qualifying time by four minutes. I was happy with that for about two weeks and burned again for just having missed my time. I ran the Hartford marathon in 2019 and made the BQ by four minutes. I swear that was one of the happiest days of my life!\n\nNow we're in the pandemic and the Boston Marathon is run-it-where-you-like and send us proof of your time. I ran my 2020 Boston Marathon on a local track, 100 laps in lane four. Finished it in 5:15. The Hartford time was good for 2021 and I ran my Boston Marathon on the course in 5:43, just three minutes longer than my target. I finally achieved my goal after two decades, another of the happiest days of my life.\n\nMoral of the story? Treat your injuries, take care of yourself, never give up.",

I've taken this approach for a few less serious injuries over the years and it's worked well for me.  Keep mobile by walking, a little running with some pain but only enough to recover from.  If I'm in that injury recovery phase and I'm out on a run and all of a sudden that pain becomes a \"this is bad\",  I stop and start working.

If you are feeling lonely, angry, like crying or even just empty - that's normal and common but not something you have to take as a fact of life. There are steps you can take to make it not as bad.

Check if your local physio has pilates classes there for injured people - might help to meet a few others in a similar spot\n\nIn some ways what I found worst was the boredom of trying to get better. Physio is boring, rest is boring, and watching the calendar tick by is also hard.

Being a low-impact activity, I figured it would be safe for my foot. The stiff cycling shoes helped by limiting foot flexion, so I didn’t risk re-injury. Since I couldn't run, I cycled a lot—about 380 km per week—and ended up boosting my FTP from all that volume.\n\nAfter two and a half months, I tried running again.

It throbbed for days.\n\nI was resigned at that point to never running again and I didn't even bother trying for a really long time.\n\nUltimately, I picked back up late last year, largely because I got tired of how long it was taking to walk every morning.

For a long time, I couldn't do any kind of athletic activity. I could hardly stand up a lot of days. Mentally dealing with that involved reframing what the point of my life is and how I identify myself as a person. I've always considered myself an athlete. I played baseball, basketball, tennis, volleyball, and competed in cross-country and track as a kid. I got more into outdoor sports as an adult. That included mountaineering, open-water swimming, backwoods hiking and camping, rock climbing, kayaking, canyoneering.\n\nBut I was never *just* an athlete. My job involves more intellectual than physical demand. I tried to focus more on that. I didn't publish them, but wrote two books. I created a toy Linux distribution. I got into a lot of forms of around the house DIY stuff from building my own servers and homelab to learning how to detail my car. I was originally a math student in college but didn't pursue higher math after school, going into programming instead. So I started learning more math, just teaching myself, going through textbooks and working through proofs and problems.\n\nIt was all about finding things I could do that gave me goals and gave me purpose. You can't only have one thing because any one thing can always be taken away.\n\nAs it stands now, I actually appreciate that I can run more than I ever did in the past. I no longer take it for granted. But I also know it isn't permanent. It may be next year or it may be in my late 80s, but I'm going to have to stop eventually.

Or just gotten pain to a manageable point? \n\n* 3:25 BQ time tells me you’re a woman under 34, and you mentioned your coach is a dude. Not saying men can’t coach women, but failing workouts consistently tells me your coach isn’t working well for you. I’ve worked with two coaches, one like you described and my current one. I previously had a lot of issues failing workouts and seeing some absurdly hard workout (like PRing a 5k in a progression run) was just demoralizing. Current coach is much better, workouts are MUCH more tailored with explicit instructions for if I’m feeling good or struggling (ie range is 85-90/400, but I can drop to low 80s on the last few if I’m on one or start higher in the 90s if it’s a bad day). \n\n* Chicago race day is a bit stressful overall. I didn’t love it and am doing Philly this year instead of trying to do Chicago again. I also don’t love the heat so wanted the coldest marathon I could find ",

While HR is going to be elevated in race, I'd not let it get near threshold until at least 25k. Given you couldn't trust your watch pace, HR can be a guide along with RPE.\n\nYour 5k definitely indicates you have the fitness to hit your goal, but your training has to match. I'd say your mileage was on the low side given your goal. Not a lot of folks are hitting close to 3 without tipping above 50 mpw. Obviously a lot of runners do, but that takes more talent to pull it off on low mileage.\n\nedit: adding to go along with some other comments, do a local smaller race. It sounds like the stress got to you, which is understandable because Chicago is such a massive race with so much activity surrounding it.

No wonder you feel so tired - you're running a lot, but you're also dealing with a sick child *and* a spouse going through a mental health crisis.\n\nThe advice I'd give that's specific to your situation is...are you doing all of this by yourself?  You don't say, but if it's up to *you* and your wife to take care of what I'm guessing is your first child and it's also up to *you* to keep an eye on your wife because she's going through postpartum psychosis...that's a lot for anyone to deal with on their own.  If you can, get help with childcare.  Find a therapist for yourself.  Talk to friends.  And keep in mind that - first and foremost - running is a hobby, not your life.\n\nIn general...I've always told myself that while peak feels hellish, it's only a couple of weeks.  Like, I've been doing a lot of miles lately (or at least trying to - I turned my ankle this morning so I had to cut a run short, but it doesn't feel terrible right now), and I've just been repeating that I can get through this and get to the taper and I know I'll feel less crazy.  It's kind of like racing, in that regard.\n\nTo not get into too graphic detail, I had quite a few intrusive thoughts during my last race (Philadelphia Distance Run).  And at some point, it was like...I just had to think about getting to the next mile marker.  And then the next one.  And then the next one.  Maybe pick off one of the elites having a rough day.  It was a miserable 78+ minutes, but I managed to get through it.\n\nOkay, one more thing: talk to yourself like you'd talk to a friend about your running goals.  Actually, talk to yourself about *everything you're going through* like you'd talk to a friend.  Would you expect your friend to deal with everything that you're currently dealing with on their own?  Would you think that friend had failed if he maybe runs a 3:05 instead of a sub 3?  Would you think that friend was successful if he *did* run his time goal, but he ran himself into the ground for it?\n\nAnd if one of your friends ran their first 20 in years, would you think it was absolute dogwater if they slogged through it?\n\n...that was way more than \"one more thing,\" but you get the picture.",

Won't share it all online but my wife had serious challenges following childbirth and I checked myself into a doctor with anxiety as I just couldn't cope. Every case is different but that was one of the toughest, most sleepless periods in my life.\n\n- Exercise is good for your mental health (as is getting outside when things are tense) so you can try to fit it in. Maybe make a schedule with non-negotiables and fit in training between events (e.g. I run to work for my long runs)? I have a calendar pinned up at home that lists (for example) that I NEED to do a long run every Sunday.

This involves some medical records/paperwork, an interview, and a physical exam.  Boston offered classification the weekend before the marathon this past year (I have Parkinsons, and that's where I got my para-athlete classification).   So....if you are interested, you can enter Boston as an adaptive athlete, hopefully get your classification, and then run in the para-athlete field.\n\nYou can read more about the para-athlete divisions here - [Para Athletes Divisions | Boston Athletic Association (baa.org)](https://www.baa.org/races/boston-marathon/para-athletes/para-athletes-divisions).  And I really recommend contacting Taylor Wilson of the BAA (twilson@BAA.org) - she is the POC for the adaptive athletes and the non-professional para-athletes and is tremendously helpful (make sure to mention to her that you are planning to run the Boston Half next month).\n\nAs I mentioned, I got my classification at Boston 2024 and ran the marathon as a para-athlete.  If you want to read about my experience that weekend, including the classification process, I wrote it up here: [Well, I'm TRYING to run...: Race report: Boston Marathon 2024, April 15, 2024 (wellimtryingtorun.blogspot.com)](https://wellimtryingtorun.blogspot.com/2024/04/race-report-boston-marathon-2024-april.html)\n\nFeel free to message me here or on Instagram ([Cristina Burbach (@welllimtryingtocat) • Instagram photos and videos](https://www.instagram.com/welllimtryingtocat/)) if you have any questions.\n\n-Cristina Burbach",

That's magnified a lot more here with the language barrier, if it was a local race I'd have just asked the pacer but that obviously wasn't an option here.

Good pacing would have been to run those at 7:20ish and gain some time on the slight downhill segments. Sounds like they were maybe concerned they may not make the time and sped up from the get go.

I decided to push forward not worry about time and just focus on a nice slow finish. Hips held up but 1/2 way thru the ankle tendinitis flared up probably due to my form degrading and the hills kicking in as I got tired and kept getting worse. By mile 10 I was doing the “just finish” shuffle and had to speed walk that last climb at 12 before jogging across the line \n\nIt wasn’t fast and it wasn’t pretty but we finished and I’m focused on slowly building up a bigger base, rehab/PT, and lots of strength work over the winter.\n\nReally fun day despite the pain cave. \n\nGood luck in Indy!",

Your idea of using them as cross train/recovery sounds good. But you will also have to play it by ear. If shift #1 is easy/calm/restful, then you can do a quality day on the “between shifts” day. If shift 1 is intense, use the “between day” as a recovery run.\n\nIf you worked out on the “between day”, shift 2 should be rest/recovery. If you rested on the “between day”, that means shift 1 was intense, so you can also make shift 2 more of a cross train/recovery day.\n\nBecause work is mentally fatiguing, it might be a good idea to always plan the “after shift 2” day as a general aerobic run. If your 2 shifts were intense, keep it on the shorter/recovery side. If the shifts were not intense and you got a lot of rest, let it be a little bit longer and throw in some strides too. Nothing exhausting, but get the legs turning again.\n\nTwo days and four days after shift 2 should be your most intense quality days. Maybe long run on “two days after” and quality workout session on “four days after”. Last day (5 days after), throw in another general aerobic run.\n\nYour schedule is tough. Good luck.

But physically a lot of it is knowing that giving 100% during taper is taking it easier and focusing on recovering. Even though you won't feel \"normal\" during taper, that I think is mostly because you've adjusted to the fatigue so your legs and body feel different during the taper. A lot of taper is \"hay is in the barn\" and trusting what you've done will be enough.\n\n* When/what is your hardest final workout? e.g. mile repeats, 2k repeats, etc\n   * In college our theory was that adaptation takes 2 weeks, meaning a workout run today will improve performance two weeks from now. In marathon training I take this as my last hard workout will be two weeks before race day and right before I start taper. I do still do workouts during taper but these are less in distance and not intended to get faster but instead to lock in the goal pace so I know what it feels like. The week of the marathon I do 2x2miles at MP with 4min rest just to lock in the pace.\n* What is your longest long during your taper\n   * This depends on mileage, but in general it will be about 14 miles.\n* % of mileage drop from your peak each of your tapers\n   * week 1 is 10%, week 2 is 25% \n* Any strides or short/fast turnover stuff you add in to maintain speed?\n   * Strides are fine but the intention has to be wake up the legs, you don't want to do something that will stress your body to a new stress. Like if you weren't doing strides before taper, don't do strides during taper because your body will have to learn to adapt to it when it should be recovering.",

A pretty modest drop; given my pretty mediocre training I decided not to really think about tapering until the LR 14 days before the race. I know from past experience I can shed fatigue fairly quickly (but also build it quickly too; instead of the normal \"3 weeks on 1 week off\" mesocycle I tend to favour something more like 2.5/0.5 or even 1.5/0.5).\n* Not really tbh; I knew leg turnover wouldn't be the limiting factor. I mostly just did decreasing amounts of MP in short to medium length intervals.

I think with experience, athletes learn to push their mental limits further but as long as you have done some high intensity training you should know what race day will feel like and you probably won't be able to mentally push yourself hard enough to hurt yourself.

The 4th km felt hard and I kept pushing while my body wanted to stop and my breathing was really laboured. The last km I knew it was my last so I decided to ignore all feedback and push like crazy so that it ended up being my fastest and I crossed the line literally at the limit. Even if my pace was the same as the first km, this time it was the effort you'd use if you were being chased uphill by ravenous lion. My HR at the end hit 172 and flattened there so it was clear that there was nothing left. I didn't die. One bit of advice - ignore pace or at least don't compare yours to that of others. My race felt like absolute max effort and I averaged 3:53/km.

Feeling apprehensive about pushing too hard in a race is completely normal, especially towards the end when fatigue sets in both mentally and physically.\n\nFor a 5k, a common approach is to aim for about 90-95% of your maximum heart rate - but you can set a lower range if that's what you're comfortable with. Assuming you're aiming for 90-95% HRMax, You can establish your baseline at your lactate threshold (LT2) pace, which is the pace you can sustain for around an hour. Your 5k pace should then be about 20-30 seconds per kilometer faster than this LT2 pace. For example, if your LT2 is 4:55/km, you could target a 5k pace of around 4:25 to 4:35 per kilometer. This keeps you out of the sprint zone, which is only sustainable for 1-2 minutes, but will still feel quite challenging and should be sustainable for 15-25 minutes with proper training.\n\nIf you have a smartwatch, setting alerts to keep within 90-95% HRMax can help manage your pace. Early in the race, stick close to your planned pace. As the race progresses, you can allow yourself more leeway:\n\n* After 1km, if you're still below 90-95% HRMax, consider increasing your pace by up to 5 seconds.\n* At 2km, consider increasing up to 10 seconds faster than your race pace if you're still feeling strong.\n* By 3km, if your heart rate allows, consider pushing up to 15 seconds faster.\n* In the final km, you can safely increase by up to 20 seconds if you have the energy, since you're nearly finished.\n\nThe relationship between pace and heart rate means that by starting 20-30 seconds per km faster than LT2, you'll approach your HRMax by the end, but the structure of your increases will ensure you stay within a safe exertion level.\n\nYou can also be mindful of signs like breathlessness, unusual chest pain, or dizziness. These are indicators to back off. For race day, sticking to a well-practiced plan could reduce your anxiety. Leave the last km potentially open for that final push, but keep the initial stages conservative.\n\nTraining runs are excellent for testing your boundaries safely, whereas on race day, focus on executing your plan smoothly. This approach should give you more confidence and keep you safe during the race.\n\nGood luck, and trust in your training and preparation!",

As a mid 30’s guy who still focuses on the 1500/mile for indoor/outdoors, here is my general game plan. \n\nFirst 200/400 - Don’t go too fast, stay on goal pace. You can’t win the race in the first 400, but you can lose it. \n\n2nd lap - mentally slightly increase effort to retain same pace, start trying to catch people that went out too fast and are over correcting, pass on straights. \n\n3rd lap - mentally acknowledge this is the most painful lap, you can get through this one lap. Hang on to another person, if someone passes you go with them. It’s going to mentally feel like you are accelerating in order to maintain pace from 2nd lap. If it isn’t hurting and feeling impossible to sustain, probably not pushing hard enough. \n\n4th lap - Hear the bell, you’re hurting but you’re almost done. Hang on to someone through the first turn, slowly start accelerating on the back straight, if there is a gap to the next person start kicking at 200 to try to catch them, if you’re on someone’s back who hasn’t blown up hold onto them during the last curve and plan to fly past them so they can’t react in the final 100. \n\nCompartmentalizing each lap really helps me mentally. You just need to execute a simple game plan each lap and not think about overall pace \n(After the first lap) or your level of discomfort.",

No one will deny that it's a difficult event, but in my opinion it's much shorter and funner than a 2 mile, 5k, etc. in that you can count the laps - 1, 2, 3, 4 - and it's very simple to break down. It can also be very tactical and there's plenty of opportunities for things to happen. Overall, I'm always very excited to run it and I don't dread it at all.\n\nI like to see it as short and fun. It's not a grueling endurance event where you are trying to hold on to a decent speed and slowly breaking down, but rather a quick four laps that you whiz through with fast and strong running.\n\nIn terms of mentality, counting the laps is great. Most people don't get too tired until the back half, and thus by the time they want to quit, they're already almost done. It's much easier to empty the tank knowing that's there's only 1 1/5 laps left than it is to grind through the middle part of a race. There really isn't a middle - the first 2 laps are the start and the second 2 laps are the sprint to the finish. In a 5k or 5 mile race, the 4th kilometer / mile is usually brutal, but with the mile that phase is trimmed down to a single lap (3rd lap). Concentrating on the race itself is also a good way to get through it - there's usually a lot of people around you due to the small distance, and directly racing against the people next to you is much more energizing than running the whole race on your own. Again, there's a lot of action in this distance.\n\nAnd lastly, I do have some phrases, though this is universal and not just for this distance. I usually sing an energizing song to myself before the race to hype myself up and try to sing it in my head while I'm running. When I'm really feeling burnt, I say out loud, \"Who's gonna carry the boats?\" And as I said before, I remind myself that it's a very quick race which flies by and there's only one or two more brief laps to get through, so I better leave it all on the track.",

If running and achievement has become a large part of your self identity (which is pretty common with today's societal pressure on grindset mentality, achievement and success above all else, etc) then really challenge those thoughts that are making you feel bad. \n\nThe big risk here is burnout leading to depression and then secondary depression but I think secondary burnout is a thing as well. That is, the burnout and associated lack of motivation and anhedonia make you question yourself and then you suffer a secondary lack of motivation and questioning about why this may be happening because it goes against your ideals of being strong, being successful etc. \n\nThe message here is that burnout will pass, it can be helpful to give it a name, e.g Bob is here, he's staying with me for a while, he'll be gone eventually but how do I manage this unwanted mental guest for a while without losing myself in the process? Active coping rather than distractive coping. Mindfulness techniques, radical acceptance, meditation, yoga are all strategies and activities that can help and there's lots of others. \n\nBe kind to yourself and keep your chin up!",

Usually in a couple of years they see very quick gains of fitness and (if they haven't ran in school) a lot of PBs in several distances. They gain a lot of racing, but also knowledge about injuries, recovery, strength & conditioning tips and training plan. Most of them gets an individual plan from a coach to get better.\n\n... until they've ran a few marathons and suddenly realize that easy days are over. If you're at certain level you probably understand that new PBs are not coming that easy and records are not improving by minutes, just seconds. And getting a new PB gets harder. If you have raced enough, you have had some races in ideal conditions with near-perfect form and it's very difficult to recreate the say level of fitness and environment each time. Also, getting better needs increasingly more work - workouts get harder, mileage goes up. That's exhausting. You don't necessarily see the results even though you work harder and at some point start to question is it worth it.\n\nIt's more difficult to accept for people who are very disciplined, because part of their mind believes that if they do everything they can and follow the training plan, the result will come, but it's not always the case when you're pushing your limits. \n\n  \nSo why do it?\n\nMy suggestion to you is not to quit running, but take a break from training plan. Run as much as you feel, not what is written in the plan. When weather is not favorable, don't go. Cut your training load to half and try to enjoy just going out and jogging part of running. Probably a good idea to leave your watch at home, too, for a while. No point to check HR and pace all the time like you're probably used to.",

I have been suffering with this as long as I can remember and have only just recently come across this disorder as a possible cause.  Your post rings true in so many aspects.  I have the noise…I think the medical term is striddor,  when I push myself to exertion, particularly when I do track the last 400 meters or coming to the end of a bust of significant exertion, my larynx closes and I make this wheezing sound that makes people question if i am about to expire.  But like you say, I do exactly the same as you, my last 100 or 50m I can push out some of my best running.  Like today, I was doing 1200m x 4.  On my last effort I ran the last 100m no problem, like I’m saving everything till the last 30 secs.  This happens when I swim reps of 100 or coming to end of a particularly long set and happens on the bike on a hill climb or sprints.    I’m generally fine if I stay in Z3/4.  I have tried different ways of inhaling air to relieve the tension and I do see a difference but am unable to maintain it for longer than 10 secs.  I see it particularly worse in winter if its cold or summer when it’s hot (I live in Mexico…but originally from the UK).  I went to see a respiratory doctor to check if I had asthma, they gave me an inhaler and said although I don’t have classic asthma it sounded like I have exercise induced asthma.  I never felt any benefit from using the inhaler so stopped taking it and never returned.  So what to do now…its interesting about the anxiety, just not sure how i deal with that because now in my mind i know that feeling (wheezing) is coming.  I don’t see any point in doing a test like what you have done, I’m pretty convinced of the cause, its just how to correct it and here in Mexico I’m not sure this disorder will be particularly well known.  I just watched a video on you tube about sound exercises that might help with controlling the breathing from the abdomen instead of the chest and throat…my guess is it will be hard to train it out of this old dog!

I know everyone here is saying to take a break for a while and that could work for some people personally for me that generally is a recipe for disaster. Once I’ve taken significant time off I know that I’m going to be slower than before and it’s going to be even harder to overcome that mental barrier so here’s what I would do. \n\nThere are two things that I’ve done in the past and I generally do them all the time to try and keep myself in line.\n\n1. Set a standard for yourself on any, all, or some efforts. These can be different rules that you determine not to break. Examples would be during a tempo run that you can slow down as much as needed but you will never walk. Or that during an interval session you will ignore some of your rest periods and take longer breaks but you will finish every rep. This can vary from workout to workout but I find setting these rules for myself keeps me in line. It’s critical that you set these rules before your workouts that way you won’t try to talk yourself out of them when things get hard. It’s also critical that you give yourself extra leeway within these rules. So for example the slowing down during a tempo run is not something you would’ve allowed yourself to do in the past but you’re still following your standard. \n\n2. Focus on the win not on the regression. Did you walk at the water stations? Sure, but you still finished the marathon, that’s a win! Did you slow down during your tempo run? Sure, but you didn’t walk that’s a win. Did you run the 10 miles you planned on? No but you still got out the door and ran, that’s a win. No one is perfect, focus on the things you’re doing right not on the things you’re doing wrong.\n\nThe last thing I would do in your situation is cut way back on the volume. Find what you enjoy most in running and focus on that rather than planning and nailing every session. Set your standards like I said but relax them compared to what you normally would. Run your easy runs easier than you normally would. Make your long run shorter than you normally would. But stick to your standards. And try to do more of what you enjoy most rather than trying to be so strict. \n\nSoon enough I think you will find that you’re not longer giving up but instead you’re moderating. \n\nIt’s all about perspective, I hope this helps. \nGood luck.",

I don't care that it's downhill. You need to ease into marathons rather than try to bank time. It's a long race, and you are asking too much from your body too early in the event to expect a strong finish.\n\nYes, training could be improved. Reaching a mileage goal is less than half the battle. How long you hold that higher mileage matters so much more. It takes time to build endurance, and the miles you do today will help you many months down the road. Your next race will be better because of this training block, assuming you don't back off the mileage now and slack off waiting for the next training block. You could also benefit from longer tempo work, anything in the 60-90 minute range, to get used to running efficiently through a marathon effort. It doesn't necessarily have to come at the end of long runs, but that is an option too.\n\nGood luck with your training and your next race.

Many of us said the shorter races because one rides or exceeds that red line of effort for all or most of the race. However, I can see how for the shorter races it can be mentally easier because you can convince yourself it’s just a little bit longer. Also, many can or do run these races along with others in the same day (or one or two days away) without much downturn in performance. \n\nFor 5k and up, one may not be riding the red line the whole time, but you build up to it for longer and then when you get there, stay there the whole time. The effect this has on your body is different than the shorter races. I remember my first 10 mile and half marathon races. I certainly could not do another one even in the same week. Going up and down stairs after the race is whole other experience 😂. And the mental aspect of keeping focused adds additional challenges along the way. \n\nSo perhaps for the race itself those shorter events “win” this question.

I’ve been injured a few times but was saddled with a whopper with 4 months total off with 2.5 of them cross training on the bike and in the pool. For the bike, I would take workouts I did on the road ex. 10x1k w/ 1:30 rest and do it on the bike with a little more volume and shorter rest like 15x3min at higher resistance and above 200watts w/ 1min “rest” at lower resistance and somewhere around 100 watts and cooldown for 15-20 min for a total of 1.5 hours on the bike. That’ll jack your HR above 150 if you’re honest with it. Also podcasts and music helped me get through it to keep my mind busy. Also, in terms of cross training, you don’t want to spend  hours a day with it, because when you do come back to running, you want to feel mentally fresh. Sometimes injuries are the rest that we never knew we needed. Some of the best performances I’ve experienced myself and seen in others, were often after an injury.

Nothing is guaranteed, but that doesn't change the fact that you - as a 20-something woman - *have already run under the current standard of 3:30*.  Which is awesome!  If the standards stay as they are - and I think there's a good chance they may, considering that there was zero cutoff in 2022 and 2023 - shoot your shot.  And if you don't, you can try again in 2026.\n\nI promise, apply.  You don't get charged unless you get in.  And who knows, you might.  I will very loudly say that the guys loudly trying to predict the cutoffs shouldn't be listened to, and trying to predict what the BAA will do is probably a fool's errand.\n\n...I'm just going to save this comment and copy paste it into every other race recap in this accursed sub because it applies so often.\n\nAnyway.  So - suggestions:\n\n* Okay, I think you might have raced a lot of your workouts, from what your recap said.\n   * What first tipped me off is you running a lot of your workouts at 180 BPM.  That implies an over 200 MHR - which might be reasonable (you're in your 20s), but is also *very high*.\n   * You saying near the end that you want to associate workouts with fun instead of \"painful tests of my fitness\" is also a warning sign.  I'll be honest: workouts are supposed to build fitness, not test it.\n* Honestly, the injury definitely had an impact - you lost a couple of the most crucial weeks.  But that was just bad timing.  However, I don't think you had a decrease in performance...mostly because you might not have ever been able to run a 3:20 marathon!  (Even if you had one good LR.)\n* Actually racing:\n   * Pace band if you need it (or write your splits on your arm or memorize them), go off of net time and mile markers.  I've had GPS go haywire on me *multiple* times, and while I haven't gone full Sara Hall yet (because chucking your watch is a *very expensive habit*, especially if you don't have sponsorships), I've been tempted enough times to.\n   * Consider the volume and rate of fluid you're taking in - you can end up drinking a lot of water fast and that can cause issues.\n   * Also, don't underestimate heat, especially coming out of winter!  A lot of people got caught out at Boston (myself included) because it was the first warm day of the year.  I imagine that Jim Thorpe was a similar scenario.\n   * And then - yeah - try supershoes.  Look, I think Saucony is still clearing out their backstock of defective pink EP3s for like $123.75 lol.  I rate this relatively low because I think if you fix the first two things and the weather cooperated, you'd have broken 3:25, but it's something to consider.\n\nAnd finally: the more marathons I've run, the more I've realized that it's not so much about willpowering your way through adversity as it is setting things up so you *go through as little adversity as possible*.  Like, yeah, you do need some degree of mental fortitude to run 26.2 miles at sub-8 pace, and some people can fight through amazing degrees of pain to get results (see: Paula Radcliffe and the very infamous photo), but the best performances are the ones where you're not fighting just to finish.  Willpower is great when you're on the line, but you can't want your way from a 3:27 down to a 3:20 (or even a 3:25).",

It doesn't have to be some crazy Alphafly-like thing, but to me doing speed work in a tempo shoe is a lot more enjoyable and easier to recover from then with a trainer. Most superfoam tempo shoes could be used for marathons as well and would certainly beat your bodys up less than Pegs. I used my Endorphin Speed 2's for 3 marathons and they felt great.

But...well, there's probably some other things going on in your case.\n\n4: Not gonna lie, OP, I was pretty surprised that your coach was having you do that many workouts.  (There's a reason 80/20 is a standard, in my opinion.)  You don't detail a week of sessions, but it sounds like a high proportion of your mileage was quality - and you had a huge volume of weekly mileage at quality.  (Like, okay - I'm old, but I don't know if I'd do that volume at 80 MPW.)\n\nI don't doubt that you have the speed.  It's just that your endurance might be lagging - and that's what easy mileage can help with.\n\n3: It's interesting.  You're right in that mentality is important.  But...like, the way you described your bonk is *classic* - and part of it is neurological.  (I'm going to go bro science for a bit, but IIRC, part of the reason you want to stop is out of self-preservation, because running a sub-3 is less important than...you know...*surviving*.)\n\n2: Eh, it's a learning experience.  That said, if you're not used to it, that is *a lot of carbs*.  So I think that part of it is just not hitting things that hard without working up to it (kind of like everything else). I think when you asked about carb loading in the general thread (by accident, I had that open in a second tab), u/JExmoor had a really good answer in my opinion.\n\n1: This is the most important thing, I think.  And I think that - in general - this gets discounted a lot.  Some people can just drop really fast race times.  But I think everyone benefits from consistency and just showing up.  It seems like you went between crushing workouts and mileage, and being hurt.  Sometimes, it's better to do - like - 80% of what you want than to do 100% and then 0% and then 100%.\n\nAll that said...like, hey, it didn't go according to plan.  It's a learning experience.

But what's its relevance? If it's for a marathon, that means nothing. Excelling in a 3k time trial or whatever doesn't translate to mastering the marathon distance at all. \n\nIt also seems to me that you're missing a few marathon essentials:\n\n- Building mileage with consistency... sure.\n\n- Mastering carb-loading and race-day nutrition... 100% needed.\n\n- Cultivating a strong mental game... will take you from 30 to 42 too.\n\n- Setting realistic pre-race goals, it was your first marathon, man!\n\nYou're right about the mental aspect being a hurdle. E.g: My experience at the Paris Marathon in 2022, where I finished in 2:55, taught me to appreciate the course's variety. Not all courses need to be flat to be enjoyable—sometimes those inclines in the later miles can be an advantage in your mind. They allowed me to start slow and finish strong, overtaking many runners in the final stretch, and I enjoyed the tunnels, they let me focus 100% in the race.\n\nIt's crucial not to fault the course even a single 1%—tunnels, twists, and all—for a bad race day.\n\nI've also known too many 5k and 10k runners who couldn't crack the sub-3. It's the mind above everything else. If that's where you're struggling, consider consulting a sports psychologist. It might be the game-changer you need. Less € on shoes, oversea races, etc... and put more into your brain!\n\nBest of luck to you man. The beauty of your position is the sheer joy you'll find in each step of progress. Report back when you crack 3, as I really hope you will.",

Carb loading is largely unnecessary given the right training, and even without the right training it does not make up for the lack thereof. But your key takeaway must be to respect the distance and get more miles into your legs. It’s unclear how long and consistent your long runs were. The overall structure of your training plan is also unclear. Hitting some key workouts is important but succeeding in the marathon is down to week-in-week-out consistent work within a pretty inflexible framework (two workouts plus a long run per week could be made to work, but one hard workout is also often enough like in the Jack Daniels 2Q plans). This repetition yields results. Your body should fatigue almost continuously and progressively over many months.\n\nIt’s unclear how often you have raced in your background. This experience is key to resolve your third point. You need to get some positive experiences in races of shorter distances in maxing out. Going into the pain cave is deeply unpleasant on many levels (your mind is always telling you to stop, your muscles hurt, your throat or lungs might burn, there’s fear you might be doing damage to yourself, your body is sending signals of all sorts; and the only way to manage it is to push through with success then look back and tell yourself most of those signals and self talk was bullsh1t and that way the voice in your head telling you to keep pace becomes stronger - no amount of training achieves this) and it takes probably 4-5 races well within your capacity (maybe 10ks or halves) to redline successfully and walk away with the knowledge of what it felt like. It’s not the same as the marathon but it does help. I would also strongly advise analysing the course in detail if you have not run it before and planning out in detail how you will feel at which point. Wind, hills, crowd support, aid stations, out and back sections, tight corners all make a difference. I remember a similar experience as yours in my first marathon - going from feeling great to complete collapse within the space of 3-4km - while some of it was mental, a lot of it is physical. The mental preparation makes sure that you maximise your physical readiness.\n\nYou definitely have the speed though. Those key workouts show it. All the best!",

The best pacing strategy is even pace or very slight negative split for most of duration of the event and then kick at the end when you are no longer going to pay for the consequences of quickly accumulating lactate.\n\nWhat you definitely do not want to do is to plan, at any point in the race except the end of it, to run faster than your planned average race pace. Banking time is really poor racing strategy.\n\nAny speeding up and then slowing down is always worse than just sticking closely to the average pace (assuming flat ground). You only slow down if you have figured out you ran too fast, but if you knew it from the start you would have been better to start slower but be able to maintain the pace better.\n\nThe main reason is that if you imagine your ideal pace for the race, exceeding that pace is very dramatically worsening your situation, but running slower by similar amount is not improving your situation as much.\n\nAlso, I admire your naivety in planning your pace so precisely. I have never seen a plan so intricate, actually executed. I assure you, if you are going to be actually racing (actually running at your limit) you will not have presence of mind to be precisely sticking to the paces or speeding up when you need to.

Your pacing approach is effectively a gradual speed up, I think that approach might be right for you because: a) You might be holding back a bit (a real VO2Max of 61 with 90km training per week would suggest sub 3 hour marathon is possible... likewise if the 39:50 10k and 1:29:28 HM were reached during training, they would indicate significantly faster race times... maybe 38:xx and 1:24-1:27)... This approach naturally pushes you a little bit... Holding back is not necessarily a bad thing, running in a manner that aligns with you is really important, b) it keeps your mind occupied in a way that works for you...  \n4) Course conditions and personal feeling/state of mind will almost certainly make your planned splits obsolete... so be prepared for that... if you can adjust to that... all the power to you.",

It's going to suck at first.  If you don't double frequently, like if you're only doubling once/week, then it always sucks. Your body isn't used to a second run in a day without sleeping and it's a rude awakening. I would try doubling 2-3 times/week, starting with a really easy short second run (like 15 minutes) until you work through that transition period and that second run starts to feel more normal. \n\nI also find a second run way easier if I take a decent 15-20 minute nap during the day. Otherwise, doing 8 miles AM + work all day + immediately try to do a 4 mile PM run is really hard, since for me that's trying to run after being \"on\" for like 11 hours straight. A quick break and chance to reset prior to second run helps a bunch. \n\nIf you don't like doubling you don't have to, but I would cut the volume back if you're doing all singles. I'd do 8 miles recovery as a single if the plan calls for 6 AM + 4 PM. IMO you're probably doing a disservice to your training by running for 75+ minutes as a single on a day that's supposed to be recovery instead of 45 minutes + 30 minutes.",

While I still feel like my best days are ahead, I’m conscious that time waits for no man and PRs will become much rarer at some stage. This makes me think a little bit about why I’m running. And for me, the answer is layered - yes, I enjoy improving my performance; but when I started performance was pretty much the last thing on my mind - the benefit of mental health through structure and working out was my primary goal; not being a “fat c*nt” was another (I don’t mean that in a body shaming negative way, but more so the sense of self-esteem obtained from doing things that for a lot of people seem to be hard). Many other benefits came along with it as well that I won’t go into.\n\nAlso, what I found out is that while absolute peak performance will find some constraints with age, there are many more dimensions in running which also define performance - longer events, different types of events, focusing on age grade, conditions etc. and most of this only becomes “available” through a timeframe of years of training.\n\nI think you did a wise thing - when I was 27 I remember a whole different set of work and life pressures to the extent that my life was sedentary until 38-39-ish.

Maybe it's a parkrun 5k or a mile time trial or something, but instead of stressing about how much you've lost, just go ahead and get some hard data. Then you can make a plan on what/how you want to train from there.\n\nAnother idea is to train for something entirely new, so you are not playing the comparison game with your old self. Train for a trail race or a 3k or some random distance at a low-key running club race, like a 7k, and get an automatic PR and have fun! \n\nI've come back from 9-10 months off due to pregnancy.

Months of work feels like a long time, but it's a unique time where you'll improve rapidly at times and a little unpredictably as you get back in shape, but that can be really fun too! Don't get me wrong, you may have hard days where you're like, \"ugh, why isn't this pace easier yet???\" But you'll also have days when you go to workout and it's like BOOM you see paces you had zero expectation of seeing yet, and that is so rewarding and great!\n\nHope this helps.",

For me, that means moderately technical trails, and it also means running in Zone 3 more than I normally would, to catch the runners high. (2) Register for a race, so you have a goal to work towards, but don’t take your first result too seriously.

Finished at 1:40.\n\nGot back into the full swing of training with monthly mileage peaking around 170-180 over the summer.  Had surgery at the end of September that required me to take two weeks off, no exercising at all.  Wasn't even able to do yoga until a week in.\n\nAfter recovery, I quickly got back into my 40+ mpw training.  Early November, I overdid it with back to back runs (running too hard and too fast the day after a workout and not listening to my body) and my calf started nagging me.  When it continued to hang around for a bit, and knowing the relationship between calves and PF from my previous experience, I decided to play it safe. Dropped my mileage down to 35 with no speed work one week and then when it still lingered, down to 25 the next week.  Improved but not as much as I would have liked.  The next week I was able to get my mileage back up to 40+ running trails, but still no speed work.  And that seemed to do the trick. Finished November with 152 miles and went into December feeling more optimistic.\n\nHit December pretty hard with regular speed work and longer miles, ending with 194 miles and a few PRs from tester races (10k, 15k and one HM that I did at 80-90% effort, 1 second slower than my 2022 race).\n\nDid my HM mid January with a chip time of 1:30:30 and a watch time of 1:30:05.

More importantly...what do you eat race morning?  You mentioned carb loading in the days before and your race strategy...but if you're not eating the day *of* the race, that can put a wrench in your plans.  (I know from experience.)\n\nThe other big thing I can think of is...on average, what % of your weekly mileage is at higher intensity (so goal MP or faster)?  Kind of contradictory, you might even want to adjust your training paces *down* a bit - like, don't call 6:35 your MP if you're nowhere near that (Daniels VDOT is extremely aspirational, IMO), maybe try 6:45 or even 6:55.\n\nBut yeah, marathons are hard, OP.

I rationalized that there is only one time in my life where I will get to enjoy the kids at this age and I want/need to be involved with them and make them a priority. \n\nBut it was a mistake. I should have just shifted my focus and not been so focused on my times in running. I just should have ran and been grateful to be running. Because without running in my life, I became resentful and felt like I did nothing for myself. Like my whole world was given up for my family. I was depressed and I gained a lot of weight and had physical breakdowns such as headaches, heart palpitations and higher cholesterol. \n\nWhen I finally ran again, I did at a time that the family was asleep - 5:00 am. I found I could get good speed and hill workouts (8 to 10 miles) on Tuesdays and Thursdays and be back by 6:30 to help get the kids up and get them ready for school. On Saturdays I would do an early 6:00 am run of about 10 miles and Sundays I would do my long runs when I was training for a marathon. The longer I would go, the earlier I would wake up. I found other people in my club that had to be on an early schedule too so I didn't always have to run.\n\nI wish I had kept up running instead of stopping all together. I could have done this schedule all along. Because I am a much better person and a better husband and father because of running. It's the intangibles of running that are the most important - the dopamine release after a run, the feeling of no matter how shitty your day is you did one thing for yourself that day. \n\nIt's really about a mindset change from \"I have to run\" to \"I get to run\". And be grateful that your wife and kids will be supportive of you. It will make you love them more. Running competitively is addictive but now you are in a different stage of your life where you just have to train purposefully. We made family vacations around going to Boston, NYC and Chicago. It's great to have the wife and kids there cheering you. Just make them your first priority and you will run happy.",

You know, those depressed, kinda irrational thought patterns that creep in after a long time with inadequate sleep. Your baby is, what, 7 weeks old? Take a deep breath. What's happening now isn't for forever.\n\nAs others have said, you have to reframe if you want to keep going. Here are my suggestions on broadening your focus to no longer focus on solely maximizing performance.\n\n1. Bring your kids along! Your baby has to be 6 months old, but your older one can start in a running stroller. Buy a Thule or Bob secondhand. Single or double (or in my case, both-- great for flexibility). Think of it as going on adventures with your kids, or sharing your love of running with them.\n2. Consider the longevity benefits of reframing. If you want to be a long-time runner, you have to accept ups and downs. PRs obviously won't last forever. Get in the fun running mindset now, and it'll be easier to stay fit when you get injured, get older, etc.\n3. Center your family's needs. It may feel better to run less if you talk candidly with your wife about how you can be the best dad and husband possible right now. Maybe she wants you around more. You'll know that you're trading running performance for a greater investment in your marriage and relationship with your kids. \n4. Personally, I think it's a lot of fun to work out with my kids! If you only derive joy from the outcome of training, there's so much to enjoy about the process itself if you take your foot off the gas.",

I succeed if I get my training in, whatever happens with race results. \n(3) Minimum acceptable week. If everything goes belly up, I know what a minimum week can be to lose as little fitness as possible (1 strength session with reduced weights, 1 run of >6 mi with strides).\n(4) shorter distances. This year the longest I raced was 5K.

While I do try to listen to my body and will adjust workouts if I'm feeling banged up or especially fatigued, there are also times when I'll dig in and force myself to push through.\n\nAs an example, I recently did a mile time trial where I was absolutely not feeling things even after warming up and debated a change in plans. Instead, I made a deal with myself: \"Just get me through the first two-and-a-half laps. If you're still not feeling great, you're free to bail on the rest of the trial). This may not work for you, but I'm the type of person who once he crosses that 55-65% completion range will almost always complete a workout no matter what. Therefore, in order to ensure I complete them I manipulate myself by setting a minimum completion goal into or beyond that range. In terms of the aforementioned workout, I can't say I felt great through those first two-and-a-half laps but reaching that final turn of the third was all I needed to activate race mode and complete the workout (spoiler alert: I performed decently all things considered).\n\nSpeaking of time trials, I believe in periodically working in such all-out efforts when the racing schedule would be light. From a performance perspective you're obviously not going to put up the numbers you want relative to your race times, but I've found those similarly hard efforts to give me increased confidence and toughness come race day. The thought process is if I can endure through such a difficult workout when undermotivated, tired, alone, and without any of the other race-day benefits, I can surely handle whatever difficulties come my way in an actual race (within reason of course). Needless to say, they aren't something you want to do terribly often for all sorts of reasons, but I think they can be a useful as a mental tune-up. Then again, if you're struggling with completing races who's to say you'll be able to complete a time trial lol. If anything, I'd imagine those odds being even lower.\n\nI also like intervals at a little faster than race pace. Sticking to race pace alone doesn't give me quite enough confidence to go out and execute that pace on race day, even with a lot of reps and minimal rest. Having that extra bit of cushion between interval pace and race pace makes me feel a little more comfortable knowing I can run a bit slower in an actual race and be right where I want to be.",

Just like the specific physiological capacities that contribute to performance we also need the specific psychological skills that meet those demands. Just \"trying harder\" tends to fail, even when we are hypothetically fit enough to do something, because we are trying to overcome too much of a psychological skill gap all at once and/or don't really know what we are doing -so we have poor ability to cope when things get hard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1.

Racing a 5k and purposefully pacing the first part of it slightly easier so you can hammer the part that you've been previously checking out on.\n   2. Running a workout with a really hard middle segment where you purposefully send yourself into a hole and practice mentally working through that feeling on subsequent reps.\n   3. Racing/time-trialling complementary distances -practice harder hurting on shorter distances and longer hurting on longer distances\n3. Bring these new skills back to \"A races\" and don't overhype yourself going in. Treat it like it's just a really hard workout and don't worry about anything beyond just executing what you're practiced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll this is assuming you are currently well trained for your goals and aren't overworked, if that is not true there may also be more training required or more rest required near term, I'll leave that judgement to you.",

I've definitely had moments like you've described in races before, but over the last couple years I've been able to improve upon that a lot, so I thought I'd share a couple pieces of advice:\n\n1. Stop worrying about the pace. I would suggest even racing without a watch, and just throw time out the window. I know it's hard, but base your goals in each race on competition, and find someone you want to beat. Get excited about the competition. Imagine yourself kicking hard at the end to overtake them, or maybe imagine making a move with 800m to go and breaking them. Anything to get excited about competing.\n2. You need to start to build your mental toughness. I understand that the brain is not a muscle, but I believe it works in a similar way. You need to develop a routine that you do daily (I suggest outside of running) that challenges you and tests you, and then get it done. You need to struggle mentally each and every day. After a disappointing cross country season my senior year of high school, I made a commitment to doing core every day and 50 push-ups every single day. It might not sound like much, but it was for me at the time. While I failed on numerous occasions, over time I got better, and more resilient. It's just about struggling every single day for long periods of time. That's how you get better.\n\nHopefully this helps! This is a very individual topic, so this may or may not work for you, but it definitely worked for me. I would just say that if you like the sounds of these ideas, make a commitment and try them out. If they excite you, they will most likely improve your performance.",

Don’t make it more than it is; just another foot race and getting from point A to point B.” My mental toughness and struggles have come from a place of being too hard on myself and, when seeing that I am not on target to hit my goal or exceed my own expectations, I get frustrated and look for ways to phone it in. By remembering that the primary goal of racing is to have fun and develop experience, I can relax a little bit. Another bit of advice that I found helpful was from working with my therapist, who helped me identify that the reason I want to succeed (I.e. run a PR) is that I consider it positive feedback and an affirmation of my work. She helped me remember that there are other positive signals that I receive throughout training, and just because I get a negative signal on one day (race day) doesn’t mean that I haven’t accomplished something or that my training has been wasted. Finally, something that I’ve told myself when things start to get hard while racing is “Don’t be afraid to let it hurt.” Remind yourself when it starts to feel hard and like you want to give up that it’s normal for it to feel uncomfortable. I’ve found that really helpful for staying present and relaxed. \n\nAll that said, don’t forget that running and racing is (presumably) only what you want it to be. If your goal was to run a sub-17 5k and you run 18:08, the universe isn’t going to reject you. Give yourself the grace to be proud that you tried, and, at the very least, cherish the experience. Hope that helps!",

Turns out they weren’t (much) slower than the previous few steps. I guess that’s what the training is for, but it’s _really_ hard to simulate that feeling in a long run workout, IMO.

All signed indicated a new PR, I was killing it in training and managing work stress well. That is up until about two weeks prior to CIM, when I started having trouble sleeping, getting super stressed about work, and felt an scratchiness in my throat that is still persisting now. We put so much pressure on ourselves to make all the work and sacrifices we make for training seem “worth it” by PRing every race. Marathoners are especially guilty of this because you only get to run maybe 2 or 3 a year. In reality, the race should be a celebration of the training. The race is just one day, and due to factors out of our control, it doesn’t always truly reflect the work we put it. That’s the nature of the marathon. \n\nSince CIM I’ve focused on being kind to myself, and I suggest you do the same. Despite the struggles you left it all out there and crossed the finish line, not to mention in a time 99.9% of people could never even dream of. The fact that you still finished, even after battling physical and mental demons, is a testament to your strength. Forgive yourself for your perceived shortcomings, and just treat them as lessons learned. I promise you everyone around you just impressed that you ran a marathon. You’re stronger for it now having overcome the struggles and finishing. \n\nWe will live to run another day. We will take these lessons and apply them in the future. We will come out of the mental and physical struggles brought on by not living up to our own expectations stronger for it. Lean into your support system, recover, and if you’re so inclined, get back out there after you’ve processed this in a healthy way. May the stars align the next time you lace them up.",

Here are the problems I had: \n\n\n- I had a 2-week backpacking trip planned for the fall. I had been mentally planning this trip for over a year and there was no way I was skipping it. I ended up taking this trip in late august and early September. I ended the trip with about 10 weeks left to the marathon. With a 2 week taper, that is really just about 8 weeks of solid training. With two de-load weeks, that’s really only 2 3-week build cycles. \n\nI would be telling this to my friends and they would be like “10 weeks, that’s so much time!” And it’s difficult to explain to non-runners how it’s not really a lot of time at all in a marathon cycle \n\n- in October I went to a concert 4 out of the 5 weekends in the month. One of these was a 2-day festival. I also had to travel for these concerts. Traveling + going to a concert each weekend makes getting a strong, successful, rested long run in extremely difficult or impossible \n\n- I went to another concert the weekend before CIM. I ended up getting the flu on Monday, and barely recovering enough to even run the race, let alone run well \n\nThat’s pretty much it. I can’t or won’t put the rest of my life on hold for running. Someone asked me “if you knew you were going to get the flu (and therefore interrupt a successful race), would you still have gone to the concert” and that’s a tough question to answer but I lean towards yes\n\nSometimes being the fast runner you want to be demands lifestyle sacrifices. It’s extremely difficult to do 100% of both\n\nI did not get the time I wanted (or even run an okay race) in CIM and it was really disappointing. But I also don’t regret doing all those things I did\n\nPost-CIM I am pondering whether to sign up for an early spring marathon or not. If I do, I will face similar difficulties - I like to snowboard and we’re going into the season, I miss cycling and want to ride my bike again, etc \n\nI’ll always consider myself a runner but there are times when I focus on cycling and don’t run for months or over a year at a time.

It's easier to build back volume than intensity, in my experience.

You might back down on your workout speed and set intermediate standards. So for example, run your repeat miles at 5:20 pace and aim for 26:30-26:40 for 8K and mid-33s for 10K. In my experience, I set sub 4:20, low 15, and <26 xc as goals and was striving for in aspiration and training/racing. Had I learned to ease up a little while training, I think I would have easily attained those goals (I did later after college, at least in the longer distances). \n\nAs far as anxiety, practice relaxation techniques--they work--and maybe work on restructuring your thoughts. First thing focus on the process, less so on outcome so that the results come from you following the process, and not as an end. Another thing you can work on is to learn to channel your anxiety into controlled excitement for the race. That take some work but you can begin by thinking of these races and seasons as an opportunity, less as a challenge that you feel you must meet on race days. When I have a big race coming up and I start to get nervous I just put it on autopilot and focus on the logistics of getting to the race and to the start line.

Going up/downhill should have a change of posture for most efficient running. There are videos about trail running specific form. Trail running shoes and even poles can be incredibly helpful for stability and speed.\n\nYou also have to focus and pay attention a lot more, imo, bc the terrain is so varied. I don't run with earbuds and I am always looking at the terrain, sort of planning in my head where I'll step and how. I have to remind myself to look down with my eyes and not my whole head, otherwise my neck will hurt later.\n\nThere's kind of a muscle-memory science to foot placement on tricky terrain that you get used to doing and eventually can do without much thought. Terrain that you need to walk, you likely will be able to run safely at some point. When I trail run with people who don't normally, they are prone to ankle twists and stumbles when I am not, and need to walk when I don't, even if it's a trail I've never run on. Sometimes if I land weirdly,  I can feel my ankle wanting to twist, or my body wanting to fall, but I am almost always able to auto-correct mid landing just out of habit. A sort of muscle memory, I guess.\n\nNow, ofc, this is all if you WANT to be the best trail runner that you can be. If you mostly want to road run, with an occasional trail just for fun, than I wouldn't worry too much about it and just find a way to accept that you will not be as \"good\" at running when you do the trails.

You got this!! A big part of getting a PR is believing you can do it, so believe in yourself! Go crush your marathon and figure things out after, one thing at a time.\n\nI had a similar timing with my first marathon but didn't know I was pregnant. Back in october, I was so tired at the beginning of my taper, had low HRV, resting heart rate was going up and felt like shit on an easy run... I thought for sure I had covid. I took a covid test that was positive, freaked out for 24 hours, realized I had zero other symptoms (except fatigue/not feeling good on runs), took 5 other tests that were all negative... it wasn't covid. I assumed it was just a taper tantrum, took a couple of days completely off and continued tapering according to my training plan. Then came race day, adrenalin and taper did their thing and I hit my goal time, negative split and finished really strong. I had light bleeding the next day, thought it was my period but 10 days later after having sore boobs for days, I took a pregnancy test and turned out I was 4 weeks pregnant during the marathon. All this to say, I had no idea I was pregnant so I didn't get in my own head about it but I was really fatigued and my HR was higher than normal. Based on my last few workouts pre taper, I could have ran probably 5 min faster that my goal time, but I hit my goal time (which felt out of reach at the beginning of the block) felt really strong throughout and had the best time. Now I'll be able to tell my son he ran a marathon with me and I feel really proud :)\n\nOn the non-athletic side, I totally understand how you feel re: pregnancy. My first thought when I got the positive test was \"I won't be able to train for another marathon next year\" followed by \"I'm not ready I don't want this my life is over\" but my family has been super excited and supportive and I'm now at peace with it and can't wait to get back in shape after the baby's born. I know it's hard to hear congratulations all around when you're not even sure you want a baby... Just know that if it's not the right time, you don't have to go through with it. It can really help to get help from a therapist if you can afford it to talk through those feelings.",

I'm in the process of coming back form 5 years of inconsistency (physical and mental health issues, surgeries, etc.), but I have a background in competitive running, sub-3hr marathon PR, mid-17s 5k PR, etc. In theory this sport comes a lot more naturally to me than it does to most people (but I also don't want to discount how hard I was working back when I was in PR shape many many years ago).\n\nI am also training for my first *spring* marathon--every other marathon I've done has been fall/early winter.\n\nAnd this is fucking HARD.\n\nI live somewhere with very *very* severe winters (some of the most severe in the USA). Winter was dark constantly. There was ice everywhere. I've slipped, fallen, and broken bones on ice in the past so I need to be extra careful. But also yeah the treadmill fucking blows. Days are getting longer but they still aren't *that* long and sometimes it's still below freezing. And I'm still not adjusted to daylight savings. I'm terrible at sleeping (my avg sleep score is laughable), and I have tons of vitamin deficiencies from general malabsorption issues.\n\nAnd I have a *mentally exhausting* job (which absolutely does impact my mental willpower to train during challenging periods) but not a physically exhausting one. I also work with a team of people. You have a physically exhausting job, and are a one-woman squad. And you seem to have a bunch of other stuff going on, too.\n\nI'm sharing/commiserating with you on all of these things because I wanted to emphasize that spring marathon training is FUCKING HARD, even for me. I'm not sure I'll ever train for another one. I'm glad you're getting your Vit D levels up via a supplement (I've been on one since Nov due to inevitable winter mental health issues), in part because coming out of winter is when people ramping up mileage tend to get stress fractures because Vit D deficiency is so prevalent around now.\n\nSo I'm not going to tell you what to do, but I will tell you that *punting to a Fall marathon won't make you a failure*. The days will be longer, you'll have more time. Personally I'm of the opinion that the marathon itself simply isn't the end-all-be-all of running (honestly it's one of my least-favorite long-distance events, I'm just doing one this spring for Reasons), so hell, if you decide you don't even want to do one at all, then don't. It's not inherently \"better\" than any other long distance race. But if you really do want to do one, do not feel like punting to fall would make you a failure. I'm also learning myself how fucking hard spring marathons are. To the extent at which like, while I obviously hit the standards, I'm not even sure I ever *want* to run Boston, purely due to timing alone.\n\nDo what you need to do to keep loving running. If a spring marathon interferes with that, then don't feel bad about bailing on the spring marathon.",

There is a reason why the marathon has become a metaphor for things that are long and difficult.

I'd run many 5ks and 10ks, several halfs, and a couple 25ks. After I did that marathon, I decided that I'll probably never do another, because the training took too much from other things I need and want to do. And I don't feel bad about that, or feel like less of a runner. All this to say, if you switch to the half, postpone your full to the fall, or never run more than a 5k again, you're still a runner.

What I \\*really\\* wanted/enjoyed was \\*the training\\*. Getting out there, rain or shine, to do my goddamned runs while I listened to my playlists and tuned my brain out. So the half marathon no longer had a tight deadline attached to it, I just had to do it eventually.\n\nNow, could I do her plan after I finish the reno, and put my business on hold and just get a 9 to 5? Probably. Do I want to get a 9 to 5 though? I don't. What's realistic for me currently is 3runs/week, so I looked at a training program that would adapt to my restrictions and give me a timeframe on when I'd be able to run the half (Runna app is amazing btw).

I went out of town for the weekend to do the race anyway, and I figured my low-key upset stomach was just nerves or stress. \n\n\nI'm not sure if that's what it was or if I caught a mini stomach bug, but I ended up visiting every single portopotty for 15 miles until I gave up and walked off the course.

I should have bailed before then and changed my plans, but my pride got in the way and all that got me was a shitty (zing) dnf. \n\n\nSo honestly, if it's not fun and it's not going to be the kind of fun, growth-causing challenge that you want, then don't do it. Change plans. Can you do a half marathon instead? I usually do one really long race each year (like a 50k) but otherwise I do half marathons and 25k races a lot.

Effort matters so much more than absolute pace, so think about the race this way: first 5 miles should feel like butter—the trap is to not go too fast here and burn yourself out. If it feels hard in the first 5 miles, you’re going too fast. Next 5 miles are about maintaining. It should start to feel harder. Think noticeable effort, but something you feel like you can manage. Miles 8 and 9 are always the grind for me in a race.  Then the last 5k is where you send it. If you’re feeling good, go a bit faster, and re-assess every mile. \n\n2. If you have an idea of your target race pace, try a couple miles at that pace in the middle of a medium distance run. If you can’t sustain that, it’s probably too fast. \n\n3. I love the 6 mile race pace trial as you approach your taper. Once you have an idea of the pace you want to run, try 6 miles at that pace. Use the results of that to assess—if you feel like you could easily do it all again, it’s probably a little too slow. If you are absolutely gassed or can’t keep the pace, it’s probably too fast. \n\n4. For your first half, don’t stress too much! No matter your time, that will be your PR. Focus on finishing and on the experience. Once you have a race and a finish time under your belt, goal setting is infinitely easier.",

I feel my energy levels are so much better with others around me and not having to think about my pace. They finally 3 miles were a killer though and not just because of the hills. I went off on my own. I found myself checking my watch more. No one to talk to. But I’m glad I pushed. The pacers suggested a time to move ahead to me as well, which was helpful.

                    "body": "I'm about the same height and was even heavier when I started running and also had knee pain early on. What worked for me was hiring a coach to assess my form and write a training plan that would ramp me slowly and changing shoes to something more supportive. I'd previously seen a PT for running knee pain (I tried to start years before and then fell off the wagon before picking it up again) so I also incorporated a bunch of exercises from my PT into my training. For me that meant strengthening my glutes because I'm quad dominant - but there are tons of potential causes of running knee pain so it's very likely yours is different.\n\nWhile losing weight will relieve some of the stress on the knees when running, muscle imbalances and poor form are very common in new runners and correcting them can help avoid pain/injury when running. Addressing those will help you now and benefit you at any weight.\n\nI definitely recommend seeing a physical therapist or a doctor.  A good PT should assess your mobility and strength and be able to make recommendations for strengthing exercises and stretches to support your running.  \n\nFinding a coach to review your running form could also be helpful. Overstriding is a common problem in newer runners and can definitely lead to knee pain. Similar to a PT, they may also be able to identify areas of muscle imbalance and recommend appropriate exercises. \n\nAnd potentially new/different shoes. There's some controversy around stability shoes and correcting pronation, but I definitely noticed a difference moving to a cushy stability shoe - especially on long runs. A specialty running store can help you find a shoe that works for you (and many of the local ones have excellent return policies that let you return shoes you've run in if they end up not working for you). If you're on a budget, don't be afraid to let them know and ask for recommendations from last year's models. \n\nAnd finally, the run-walk-run method can be a great strategy to build mileage. You may be able to use it while working on strengthening with a PT (it's a good idea to talk about your plans with them). Because walking uses the muscles slightly differently than running, many people find they can go longer distances with less risk of injury - and Jeff Galloway suggests it can be just as fast or faster as running continuously. I know it can feel like a step back, but it can really help you take a huge step forward long term by helping you build fitness while working on injury prevention.",

I have an 18 month old (just one thankfully) and also wake up at 5am to run on my long run day, and 6am on the other days. I run 6 days a week with one “rest” day where I do either strength or yoga or both. I have never experienced a panic attack like you’ve described but when I first jumped to 50-60 mpw and started getting into the really big workouts I felt like I was constantly on edge, had trouble sleeping, like I was tired and wanted to sleep but just couldn’t. I make it a point now to make sure I’m in bed by 9pm if I have to wake up at 5 and 10pm if I have to wake up at 6. I make sure I eat a big pasta or other carb heavy dinner the night before a big run. I’m on my second iteration through Hansons and don’t have the same issues now, so think part of it is just your body needing time to adapt to the volume and intensity. Pfitz is hard and I’ve looked at it before deciding to go with Hansons because some of the long run workouts just felt too hard. I’ve had to do 13-14 miles with 10 at goal pace as the peak run in Hansons and that was super hard. I can’t imagine giving up a rest day after a workout like that for a streak. Honestly curious what is the purpose of the streak? Because the plan is designed with rest in mind and recovery is a necessary part of progress… the streak run does nothing for your training and would be the first thing I would drop. I would try really getting a proper rest day and seeing if that helps - not just with the panic attacks but maybe the quality of your workouts will get better too?",

My body had taken my excess of overtraining and my underfueling as a \"oh we're in extreme danger\" mode and it was basically like I was in permanent fight or flight response. I had to take time off from any sort of physical activity that raised my heart rate to a place where my body would think I was in duress. I rested, relaxed, meditated. In addition, I've had to really focus on making sure I'm not in Low Energy Availability (LEA). This isn't about just overall under-fueling (which was a problem) but making sure I was fueling properly *before* I was going for a run and asking my body to perform a physically stressful activity. It took a very long time (months) to be able to go to sleep properly and not feel a sense of panic. It was slow but it felt like every day was less and less panic-filled. Basically, I was trying to show my body it was safe, that I would listen to it when it asked for rest and food.\n\n  \nThis is definitely fixable and I wish you the very best!

General overwhelm is a trigger - signing up for too many things - too many kids activities, too many work commitments, too many training commitments.

You want to work on going longer at a slower pace before you work on getting faster.

Just to put it into perspective: a more advanced runner with an easy pace of 5min/km only takes 25 minutes for an easy 5k. With your pace you’d take 43-44 minutes of continuous running.

The guided runs have helped me immensely to not look at my phone and judge my pace and distance during the run. It’s very beginner friendly. They have a 5k plan that very gently works up from 5 minute runs to running 5k with a mix of easy runs and intervals. I used it when I first started and did amazing progress with it. I found it really helped build confidence to slowly add time on feet. The plan in itself takes 8 weeks and you’re running your first 5k after 5 weeks I think. Maybe have a look and give it try.

If you can rest a bit more now and accept the small setback in training, do it. It's a symptom of something else, so maybe see a physical therapist to get to the root cause? I've started seeing orthopedic urgent cares pop up (but haven't been to one) so maybe you could get some quick advice from some place like that? I also have had some good experience with chiropractors. The other option is to just keep pushing through and risk further injury/pain. \n\nI'm also training for my first half and even though I've done races before..

I do it 3 times a day. If you feel pain, do both feet at the same time. Continue doing this even after you heal. Do calf stretches regularly.\n\nTendinopathy has a very specific pain scale-related healing trajectory. You need to assess your level of pain and exercise accordingly. You don’t want to stop running entirely, but if you have pain any higher than about a 1-2 on a scale of 10, stop running. When you’re able to run on a 2 or below, start slow and just do a small amount of mileage at a time. Also try to run mostly on flat surfaces/avoid hills as you heal.

Be careful with the garmin workouts if you are training for ultra distances. In my experience, the garmin “long runs” tend to not be long enough for ultra distances. (You could make it work for a 50k, but definitely nothing further than a 50k). \n\n2. Pay attention to your body over the coming few weeks and have a low threshold to cut back if you are feeling fatigued. You do NOT need to be hitting 60 miles a week to hit a 6:30 50k. You do not want to get injured over-training. \n\n3. The race sounds relatively flat (as far as ultras are concerned). Just be cognizant that your race terrain matches your training terrain. Eg if you train mountains but run a “flat” race, you increase your risk of going out too fast because it feels “easy” and struggling in the back section of the race.\n\n4. Don’t get hung up on hanging with the front of the pack at the start of the race even if you perceive yourself to be a “front of pack” runner. So many people go out too fast. Focus on running YOUR race at a comfortable pace for the first half of the race.  The real racing begins at mile 20. \n\n5. On race day, keep in mind that it is a long day and anything can happen. Stuff you don’t anticipate will happen; just try to roll with it and adapt as best you can.  That shirt that was fine for three hour runs may NOT be fine/cause chaffing for 6 hour runs. Some of this stuff you just won’t figure out until you get experience running for that long. \n\n6. Last but not least, if you aren’t having fun, it’s time to eat something and slow down.",

But if you finish the program, it is very likely that you’ll be able to run 5k the next time you go for a run! \n\nIf your goal is 5k, I also recommend finding a 5k loop.

I enjoy doing all of these things, but they f+*# with my recovery and ability to gain fitness from training. I am genuinely at my most relaxed when it is just me doing my routine. \n\nNot seeing improvements after a sustained period of training could be your body's way of telling you that it has struggled to absorb your training and make the adaptations that you deserve from the hard work you put in. There really is little point in doing a workout that you can't recover from, because you won't reap the benefits.\n\nSo the first thing you can do is to add in more rest and short easy runs between your meatier sessions (and space the hard runs further apart from each other) and see if you start to show up to the next session feeling more fresh and energised. If it means having to cut out some sessions because there's more than your body can take, it's far better to do fewer sessions that you can actually get something out of, than to tick all the boxes on the sessions on a plan but feel absolutely worn out.\n\nI learned how important getting in more rest is when I was forced to rest from hip tendonitis and a sprained ankle. Training volume went way down, but I got faster when I started up again even though I did not gain any speed during marathon training when my mileage was two to three times higher. \n\nBe honest with yourself about the recovery times you need.",

I also managed to do something horrible to my ankle when I was just over mid-way through a 12 mile point to point run where I was meant to be getting the train back to my starting point and there were no transport options where I was. I basically walked the rest of the way to the train station and it hurt but it was doable. I probably could have called a taxi to be honest, I was just too determined to finish it!\n\nThere are a lot of stories out there of people who have been able to keep going through runs/races despite all sorts. I listen to a lot of podcasts and people doing these amazing adventures and being able to cope with challenging circumstances reminds me that if it’s possible for them, it probably is for me too. Though there’s also something about what’s enjoyable for you and safely building up experience.\n\nI think I also trust myself to be able to manage a situation where something came up on a run. There are mitigations you can put in place like ensuring you have what3words installed on your phone, letting someone know where you are and checking in with them, carrying a battery pack and cable for your phone, having a first aid kit in your pack, planning ‘checkpoints’ where you may be able to pick up water/snacks if needed etc. As someone with anxiety myself, there’s something about being able to carry out a personal ‘risk assessment’ of sorts, put mitigations in place to lower the risk level to a level you’re happier with, and to weigh up the risks vs benefits. For me, I love running in new places, I love point to point runs and the idea of travelling somewhere by running there and so the risks are worth it as long as I’ve taken steps to manage them where I can. I can’t control for every eventuality though. Some people are quite happy to accept a much higher level of risk than I am and are more likely to just wing it and deal with problems later, and sometimes those people do amazing things I could never dream of because I would have wanted to do more training or preparation first, to the point where maybe I’d never feel prepared enough! It’s very very personal. I think then also doing these things helps to build your confidence, and it’s about taking tiny steps and setting small goals before moving on to something more scary/challenging. I think learning to trust myself and that I can have my own back has been one of my biggest journeys.\n\nMy final point is that I often have to argue back to my anxiety by using evidence I have that disproves what my brain is telling me and reminding myself that thoughts aren’t facts.",

Just because it takes a calorie deficit to lose weight, try to avoid doing that with \"short cut\" convenience meal substitutes. If you are doing a deficit, it matters even more that you make every calorie count by getting enough micronutrients and fibre to really strengthen your hormonal and immune system. You can obviously exercise during weight loss, but it's really better to keep the exercise volume low to moderate so that you are not creating any significant fatigue or recovery needs. Once you feel happy with your weight (it probably shouldn't be trying to get back to your lightest though - That's not necessary) you can go back into maintenance level eating when you start training again more seriously.",

I suggested she just start adding mileage, power zone training, and lifting at her current weight, because there was no reason she couldn't ride hard 10lbs heavier. That conversation was 3 years ago and this week she brought it up again and said how powerful that comment was in shifting her mindset around her body and training, she's kept the 10lbs and is BEATING her pre illness PBs! \n\nI'm not going to tell people what to do or violate bodily autonomy, but sometimes a gentle push back or presentation of an alternative to weight loss rhetoric can be really powerful.\n\nThanks for speaking up!",

The fact that you're interested in and motivated by your performance, even the fact that the idea of racing gives you anxiety. Personally, I only feel anxious about things that I care about and identify myself with; there's something meaningful at stake if things don't go as I'd like, and that potential loss is where the anxious feelings come from. But the flipside of that is that there's lots to gain in doing the things that make me anxious--they're ultimately what take me closer to the kind of achievements that I care about, and the kind of person I want to be.\n\nMaybe that's just projection though. I was someone who ran a lot but didn't care to race for a long time; my Mum would often suggest that I get into racing, or join a club, but I 'didn't want to get too nerdy about running.' Anyway, long story short, I came around to the idea a few years back, and getting into competitive running has been a huge net positive in my life since then.

Effective speed work is about short bursts, not running a sub-20 5k from a cold start. When you’re just starting, speed workouts can be as low key as a 1 mile warmup, 5 100 or 200 meter sprints (that’s 1/4 or 1/2 way around a track so not super far) with 2 minutes of rest between each rep, then a mile cool down. Over time you add reps or sprint distance, but these workouts don’t actually have to be long or far. \n- They also don’t need to be continuous. Breaks are fine and encouraged. This was what threw me off when I first started incorporating speed work. I’d always measured the success of a workout in distance-over-time or weekly/monthly miles so the thought of stopping to rest mid workout seemed counterintuitive to me. With speed workouts, you’re not optimizing for distance so resting, sprinting, starting, stopping, etc its fine. This is exactly why speed work isn’t about running a 5k as fast as possible, it’s about running short bursts as fast possible, increasing the distance of those bursts, and then eventually connecting them into longer, faster runs. I spend a lot of time literally laying down on the track. \n- training plans with one speed workout a week helped me do it, but not overdo it. I use garmin training plans but there are ton out there. I would have never known exactly how to structure a speed workout before seeing one automatically in a plan I was using, my instinct would have probably been to just “run a mile as fast as possible once a week then add more distance as soon as I’m not dying from it.” The first time I saw it broken down into a warmup, small intervals that comprised a total distance of maybe a mile, then a cool down, it blew my mind. It felt so much more manageable and it totally was.\n- using a track. I’m lucky to have one exactly 1.5 miles from my front door so I get a warmup in on the jog there. I only run outside, and speed work is really hard in the wild so using a track has been instrumental. It provides an even running surface that’s measurable, you can set up a bit of a “camp” with water and something to munch on so you can focus on running unencumbered, and it’s just an overall more controlled environment.   \n- running in cooler conditions. I live in Texas so this is relative but I only do speed work when there is no sun, either early in the morning or after sunset. \n- alternating some hill work also seems to make speed workouts easier. Once a month I’ll sub a hill workout for a speed workout. They are their own special beast but I’m convinced they contribute to getting faster even though it’s brutal. I found a stretch of road that’s exactly a quarter mile with a gentle slope. I am the king of this hill. It’s good to locate a spot like this with a little slope and use that as your hill spot. Doesn’t need to be Everest. \n- instead of doing time trials often, I do tempo workouts to gauge the training effect of speed work. I’ll do a time trial of a 5 or 10k every 15 weeks or so but I do tempo workouts at least weekly. These don’t need to be crazy intense, usually a mile warmup, some amount of time or distance at race pace (10-30 minutes or 1-3 miles depending on my current training goals), then a mile cool down. Over time I’ll make the tempo portion longer and longer, but my comfort and endurance tends to be a good litmus test of the effectiveness of my speed work. \n- give it a month. I dreaded speed work for exactly 3 weeks when I first started it, then with little wins I started to look forward to it more and more. Now it’s my favorite kind of workout because it’s actually the easiest to execute logistically, especially on a track versus, say, a 10 mile long run in Texas heat which is going to toast 2 hours of my day, require water and fuel, require planning around conditions, and will put me at least 5 miles from home in the loop that I do. \n- using a garmin watch just took the thinking out of it. I would upload my training plan speed workouts and it would just vibrate at me when I needed to run intervals. \n\nAnyway, from someone who used to dread speed workouts and now loves them, the key is to just start doing them. Go easy at first, you may surprise yourself in terms of what your body can handle.",

This can be really slow, and it's ok to take a few minutes of full rest between the warmup and your time trial, so don't worry about wearing yourself out. But remember that the first 10ish minutes is going to *suck* if you're starting cold, so get that out of the way before the time trial begins.  \n\n2. During the time trial, just *keep moving*. You don't have to keep up the same speed you did at the start. Maybe you started too fast, then after half a mile you're like \"oh my god I can't do this.\" Well, maybe at that speed you can't! So slow down. You can certainly cover 5k in *some* amount of time. Just find out what that amount is. Walk in the middle if you need to. Then get back into a run and finish as strong as you're able. \n\n3. Shorter speedwork is fine, but honestly? I'd do the 5k time trial and get out of your head about it. Maybe you're hoping for 25 minutes and it ends up being 35. *So what*. Plug \"35:00\" into a training pace calculator ([here's one](https://vdoto2.com/calculator/)) and use the paces it gives you to do some speedwork. Next month, do another 5k time trial. Guarantee you'll have improved, maybe partly due to training and partly due to mindset (\"ok, I've done this before, I can do it again.\")\n\nYour body is absolutely able to do this. Your mind doesn't have to believe in your body.",

In 2020, I got tired of sitting around at home and social isolating, put on a pair of random sneakers, and tried to run for 20 minutes. I wound up aggravating an old ankle injury and for almost three years I struggled with peroneal tendonitis. My insurance didn't cover physical therapy without a referral, and it was impossible to get a doctor's appointment. I wore an ankle strap from Amazon and just carried on and limped about. I tried to address it with yoga toes and looking up PT exercises for peroneal tendonitis on youtube and it felt like it was starting to get better, at least good enough to try to run a 5K in the summer of 2022. But this really set things off, my ankle injury returned and on top of that, I wound up getting a knee injury. I thought that was it for me, no more running, or exercise, and I was doomed to never wear cute shoes again. \n\n  \nLuckily, I got a new job with better insurance. I finally got an annual exam, got a referral for physical therapy, and did all of my prescribed exercises religously. My PT used to be a runner, so she knew all about weak IT bands, weak hip adductors, and weak ankles. Eventually, she started me on a return-to-run program, never running two days consecutively and taking frequent walking breaks, and emphasized repeating the PT exercises and working my way though increasing resistance. It was so hard. Some days I'd feel back to normal and try to run and push myself, but I'd pay for it the day after with the frustrating return of ankle pain (and tight calves, too!). Sometimes the pain came back for no reason at all and I just had to sit there, working with a resistance band and feeling like I was going nowhere. I really had to force myself to go slow and pay attention to my body. After three months of diligent PT exercises and gradual running, I \"graduated\" and started running slowly, trying to stay in Zone 2, for longer and longer distances. It took a while, but I eventually finished Hal Higdon's half-marathon Novice 1 plan (12 weeks) and ran my first half earlier this month. \n\n\n\nIf I hadn't been injured for three years, I don't think I would have had the patience to work my way slowly through the PT, but I'm so glad I did. I never thought I'd run a half and I'm so grateful for days when I can run, even when it feels shitty. I fully expect that these injuries might return, or new ones might pop up, but now I know that these are signs to stop, slow down, rest, and re-visit some PT routines. I can also wear cute shoes finally (although my feet have gotten much bigger from running :,) )\n\n  \nHang in there! I hope your recovery goes well and as linearly as possible :)",

In Jan ‘24 I had my first ever real injury and it has nothing to do with running. I tripped on the stairs, broke my 5th metatarsal (foot bone) and sprained my ankle. Oohh boy did it suck. I was non-weight-bearing for an entire month, and then in a boot for another 6ish weeks. During early recovery I hurt my back badly due to imbalances from being on crutches, hurt it so badly I could hardly get out of bed- and then caught influenza A. Talk about a shit show of a season.\n\nAnyway. 10 months later I’m healed and running again just fine. Not as fast as before but that could be more of mental thing than physical. I’m also stronger than ever because I’ve put so much effort into strength training over the past year, starting with body weight during my injury and now using the peloton app. I’ve been focusing a lot on core and lower back, so I don’t hurt my back the way I did earlier this year.\n\nMy advice is to focus on what you CAN do and use it to invest in your long-term health. I mean, I could barely do anything for two months, but I started a core routine that stuck and now my core is stronger than it’s ever been. Also, focus on eating nutritious foods that will help you recover faster. Because my injury was a broken bone, I incorporated lots of broccoli, leafy greens, and dairy products into my diet.",

I have not found the \"magic bullet\" to cure my lack of motivation, but I can tell you two things that have brought me some relief:\n\n* Permission to fail: I am recovering perfectionist who has historically bought into the lie that I had to follow a running plan exactly to the letter for my runs to count. If my plan said run 10km and that was too daunting, I would not run at all. But the reality is, any movement is better than no movement and even walking once around the block is a victory on a hard day. So I tell myself to just get outside or on the treadmill and take it second-by-second. If I take one step and can't go on, I have permission to stop. If I'm feeling too winded, I have permission to slow down and walk for a while. If I need to turn around a quarter of the way into my run, I have permission to do that. And most of the time, I actually do complete the run because once I get started, the momentum and endorphins carry me through.\n* Self-compassion: Even when I give myself permission to fail, sometimes it's still too big and scary to run. But that's okay. The world is not going to end because I didn't run, and tomorrow is a new day. My natural inclination is to be angry and ashamed when I miss a workout, but I am actively trying to respond instead with self-compassion and soothing. I tell myself I am doing my best to survive in a challenging world and not every day is going to be a victory. So I give myself permission to indulge in some self-care like a hot bath or going to bed early and promise to try again next time.",

Run for a bit, walk for 1 minute, repeat. It doesn't matter how fast you go, just get out there!\n\n\\- If you're self-conscious about other people seeing you, go to a gym at off hours and hit the treadmill, or find somewhere safe to run when it's dark early in the morning or in the evening (if possible)\n\n\\- Log your runs with an app like Strava or MapMyRun. It's really motivating to see if you can beat your previous distance, or go a little faster, and make progress.\n\n\\- Consider something like \"Zombies Run\" app, where every workout gives you a little bit of story, that's a great incentive to keep you coming back. There's a marvel version, too!\n\n\\- If your motivation is REALLY tanking, don't be afraid to bring it up with your doctor, maybe you need to adjust your meds!\n\nSending lots of love!",

Nothing fancy, D3 school, but I loved running and competing, and couldn’t imagine my life without the athletics that had been a huge part of it. \n\nNot even a week into college training I started feeling a horrible pain in my knee. I went to our trainers, multiple doctors and physical therapists. No one could quite figure out what was wrong. The best guess was ITBS, but more severe than most had seen. I was doing hours of PT, stretching, icing, heat, stem - everything and the kitchen sink every day for months. Finally, our trainer sat me down and told me I’d likely never compete again. I definitely wouldn’t be competing at the college level. \n\nAnd I didn’t. I could jog occasionally without being in excruciating pain after a few years. I pushed it too hard a few years after graduating and ended up right back at the PT, again unable to run, barely able to walk without being in pain. I’m now 30 and seem to have finally figured out the mix of strength, stretching, and just better running habits that have allowed me to get back to it. But in the meantime I found other passions. I took up biking, kickboxing, and swimming at different times over the years. I started going to regular yoga and Pilates classes. I also tried completely new hobbies outside of the exercise realm. And the thing is, I didn’t miss running after a bit. I’m back in the cycle now because I like the competitiveness of races to keep me motivated, and because I didn’t want to get super invested in biking (those bikes are expensive), and I have a thing about keeping my nails long and getting my hair wet, otherwise I like kickboxing and swimming more than running. \n\nPoint is - life changes. You change. It sucks to find out you can’t do the thing you love anymore, that the plans you had aren’t going to come to fruition. But life goes on.

Sometimes therapy can be frustrating and frankly sometimes I couldn't stand my therapist's suggestions because even though she meant well, but that was because she, too, envisioned that there was *something else* (hikes, biking, swimming, etc.) that could equally fill that gap. For me, there wasn't. Maybe for you there is, just not for me. Eventually what helped me was understanding that I was actually in grief because I'd lost what felt like the most core part of my identity. I'm even still tearing up reading this and my setback was literally 5 years ago.\n\nI mentioned swimming earlier and again, I don't want to lie to you and tell you that it's \"the same\" as running. But of all possible activities it's the one that makes me feel most... at peace? I haven't done it in a while, but I always did feel wonderful and amazing from it. I just can't go \"as hard\" while swimming as I can while running because my swimming form is so shitty. It really does make me feel good though. So I definitely *encourage* it but I also don't want to *lie to you* about it. That said, for you it may genuinely fill the same niche, so do leave that option open. I know other people who really have come to love long bike rides and regularly throw down 50-100 mile rides, but biking was just never \"it\" for me--I think it's because of the sitting. The sitting just makes it feel SO UNLIKE running. So I like that swimming doesn't involve sitting.\n\nNow, I don't really know much about rhumatoid arthritis so maybe there is a way to keep running, just not the way you used to (obviously doctor stuff). Make sure your doctor knows how important this is to you so they can figure out if there's a way to continue. Personally yeah, I still do run. But like, as a point of comparison, my former marathon pace was 6:40 min/mile, and yesterday I raced a 10-mile at 7:30 min/mile, and I really can only manage some 15-25 miles weeks, immediately followed by some 0-5 mile weeks due to some sort of issue that arises. But I can run, and I can sort-of race, just not in a way that feels as intense as I used to.  So that option might be out there for you, but not being your doctor I really have no idea.\n\nI really do wish you luck. It's something I've found that not very many people can understand.",

Figured it was out of the question. 1- it wasn’t. I started again last year. No pain. But that was after I found the right medicine plan. THAT’S the tricky part. One I got to an equilibrium I wasn’t having flares and cycling prednisone off and on. (The only perk of prednisone was being able to run like I was 19…doesn’t outweigh the other side effects.) \n\nAnd that balance of meds and long term not being in pain got me back out. When I wasn’t running - yoga. Which, I recommend anyway because the flexibility and strength is good for your joints and it helps with stress management which is HUGE for autoimmune and keeping flares away. Also, weight training. This will help with injuries and with the RA stuff in general. \n\nI wouldn’t eliminate the possibility of running but be ready for it to look different for you. Help yourself by doing the other things that contribute to low flares - diet, other exercise, stress management, medication vigilance.

The pandemic had gyms shut down and led me to catch the running bug again and develop new injuries - this led me to get back into phisio and that’s when I asked for an assessment for my old ankle injury resulting in an injection and more phisio. After a long recovery I’m now running again and did 3 half marathon since. The strength regime I learnt during phisio has been instrumental in preventing new injuries. Of course I don’t know the details of your condition and whether you could get back to running in the long term but if it wasn’t for the pandemic I probably would have never considered running again due to my fears the previous injury would worsen again.

About 1.5 years ago, I decided to try the run/walk method for a full year (GENTLE walk & jog intervals), and it never triggered any pain. I am also now able to do straight runs without pain! It was hard to hold back at first, but it honestly transformed my relationship to my body and exercise - being able to be outside and still do the same routes and trails I loved without pain became so valuable to me that I was able to fully embrace the idea of maybe never running again the way I once had. It’s nice to be able to run and train “normally” again, but I’m much better at honoring the exercise I’m able to do in the moment. Sometimes, if I’ve had an emotionally tough day, I’ll implement a run/walk or just a walk, and I still feel accomplished with that.  \n\nAnother option for exercising outside is open water swimming if it’s available to you (definitely get a triathlon coach/work with a triathlon team or find an open water swim coach even if you’re comfortable in the pool, bc it’s a totally different beast). I swam competitively in high school & it never caused any flare-ups! I also have grown to enjoy outdoor cycling. My city is not bike-friendly at all, so I only go with cycling groups. Your local bike shop probably has a group ride you can join!  \n\nWishing you all the best ☺️",

Bulgarian split squats, single leg glute bridges, core work are all so helpful for building and maintaining leg and core strength.\n\nProgress is not linear either—all the running you've done in the past prepares your body for the future, especially with your tendons and ligaments.

The elliptical machine is great for this, just try to get your heart rate up as much as you would while running and it honestly will preserve a lot of your fitness. I know this as during my last injury I didn’t bother Crosstraining and my fitness plummeted rapidly compared to when I swam/cycled/used the elliptical. \nMentally, it’s important to remember that injuries are a common occurrence for runners and a big part of the overall journey to becoming more resilient and stronger. Let yourself cry and mourn for the loss of the hobby you love, but equally remember that in the grand scheme of things, a. Few weeks without running isn’t a lot. \nI had a bone stress reaction in both my tibias from running at the start of the year, which it took several months to recover from, followed by a tear in my hip flexor after I managed to get back up to speed. I’ve now just PR’d in the 5k despite these two big setbacks this year. \nBoth times, I felt like my world was crumbling (dramatic but true!) and now that I’m recovered, I can’t believe that I was so upset. \nI know it’s a cliche but with running injuries it really is a case of get knocked down 5 times, get back up 6 times. Every time you face a setback, you have to accept it and prepare to make a bigger comeback.\nYou’ve got this!!!!",

Just ensure you give yourself time to train and recover and do those longer training runs of 18+ miles just so you mentally know you can do it as well as get your body used to running that far.\n\nThe biggest thing I found when I trained for my first marathon earlier this year is that the actual race was the ‘finish line’ and that all the training that goes into it was the real marathon. Through rain, shine, wind etc it’s a mental battle to want to get out there sometimes but pushing through it all means that you get to celebrate all that hard work in the actual race! It’s a great feeling crossing the line. \n\nThe other difference in actual training is that when you get into your high mileage weeks and are doing long runs things like pre / post / intra run fuelling, electrolytes and recovery become a lot more important to sustain your activity level / avoid injuries as much as possible for the length of the program. And lastly just remember that it’s a lot of time on the road running. Not just the event itself but also all the training. Whatever time you devote to a half marathon you are going to devote double that at least for the marathon, which can be hard with work and life sometimes so some sacrifices have to be made at times!! (Also be prepared to do so much laundry lol).\n\nOverall, it’s absolutely possible to achieve your goal. Find a training plan that works with your schedule - Jack Daniels, Pfitz, Galloway, Higdon, Nike Run Club, Runners World etc. Follow it as best as you can. Every week or two, you add a little bit of mileage to your long run. Try some runs with a bit of goal marathon pace in to see how it feels. Pretty soon, you’ve built it up and are ready to go.

Marathon training was also more expensive - going through shoes faster, fueling started getting expensive, I felt like I was constantly spending money on gels & had to switch to candy as a cheaper option, and my regular grocery bill was getting steeper. Also intra-run fueling was different for me for half training vs. full - I never had fueling issues during half training, but for full training I learned I start gagging around the 3 hour mark, so it was a lot more trial & error & figuring out a better strategy.\n\nFor the actual race distance, the hardest miles were 11-12 when I realized I wasn’t even halfway yet (but would’ve been nearly done if it was a half lol).

I did some harder workouts, but the time commitment was the same. \n\nThe long runs are obviously longer, but I started marathon training not long after running a half, so my early marathon long runs were about the same distance as what I’d been doing for my longer MH training runs. I think I started around 16-18k and built up to 34k, so it was a steady progression instead of a big jump. \n\nThe race - it’s a different beast, but most of the difference (IMO) is mental. It’s definitely not just two half marathons back to back. The cliche is that the first half is your first 20 miles and the second half is the last 6. I find that consistent training makes all the difference for me. I can slack off and still push through a half marathon, but I need to stick to my training plan if I’m going the full distance. *if* I do that, I can trust that I’ll make it through. A marathon is tricky because you can’t really practice it before you do it. You can practice all the different parts of it, but you have to trust that it’ll come together on race day.

That realization sucks (this is where therapy might help in a more general way)! However, that doesn't mean that running can't be part of your identity.

I also have some outstanding issues on my right side to do inherent asymmetries in the body that impact that side for me (basically right inward rotation that throws off the SI joint and gate). I had to address these with weights and work to strengthen my glutes. I'm primarily a weight lifter first and a runner second. For me, and to my way of thinking, strength training/running-cardio/mobility work are the holy trifecta that make for balanced movement in my life. Sure I have my preference and devote more time to the weight lifting but it would suffer if I didn't do the other two things. \n\nMy goals have very much shifted due to aging. I really think a lot about functional movement at this point. I wish I had access to the information I have now 20 years ago. I might have saved myself some functional issues and injuries. I primarily have followed Conor Harris's channel on addressing some of my dysfunctional movement patterns and they've really helped me get back to running and doing squats without shifting to one side to compensate. However I do need to stay up on those exercises that keep my glute medius firing properly. I think PT isn't a set it and forget it thing.

It was bad. I got slower, had stress fractures, was sick all the time. At the start of my junior year, I decided I wanted to be healthy, and threw out the scale, stopped ALL tracking, and started learning to eat to hunger. My junior and senior seasons I ran a MINIMUM of 20 lbm heavier (no scale, not even at the dr's office, but given pictures/clothing size changes, best guess), and PR'ed in every distance.\n\nAfter college, I started working full time, and worked on my nutrition (mostly just adding more protein to my diet) and following hunger queues even closer. No tracking, no scales, just educating myself on nutrition and experimenting with what worked with my body. And after 2 years of eating enough, fueling every activity (running, climbing, lifting) my body composition changed dramatically. It started carrying muscle, I had visible ab definition, and I was able to run faster than I ever managed in college pulling in weekly mileage up in the 70s without injury.\n\nThis took a MASSIVE mental shift, from aesthetics to performance. But what I found was that after an initial recovery period (b/c your body is in starvation mode), that everything evened out, and I was able to see gains in every aspect of my life.\n\nFor helpful resources, try working with a registered dietitian and possibly a therapist. Throw away the scale (I didn't step on one from the age of 20- 32 and it is sooo freeing). Stop tracking calories/macros and learn to eat intuitively.\n\nAnd note- restricted eating behaviors don't just disappear overnight. It takes time, work, and support to kick the bad habits. It's like an addiction, one that society worships, and you'll probably be in recovery for your entire life.\n\nIf you can't afford an RD, then see if you can take a master class from [Holley Fueled Nutrition](https://holleyfuelednutrition.com/services), (RD).

I loved running because it helped me burn a ton of calories but it never felt good. It always felt hard and when I finished a run, I pretty much always felt like I was going to faint and my blood pressure would tank. My quest for weight loss led me into disordered eating and it took at least a decade for me to undo the emotional damage I did to myself then.\n\nI'm 46 now and have picked up running again but this time it's part of a regular and healthy amount of exercise routine (not a 3 hour a day one!), and I eat as much as I need to.

The difference I feel during my runs AND afterwards is incredible. I alway thought running hurt - and that it was normal to be in pain after a run. Turns out that's not true! I've even found running has been helpful for allowing more of the so called \"unhealthy\" foods in my life because I've noticed when I have some of those things it makes my runs so much better (bagels in the morning! ice cream after dinner!). It's revolutionized how I think about ALL food as having a deserving place in my diet.\n\nI thought that running wasn't going to be something I'd get better at in my 40s - but I'm proving to myself every day that by fueling myself WELL that not only can I still run but it can feel better than it ever did.

Reading your post, my first instinct was that your blood sugar is likely low. Make sure you are getting enough carbs (complex carbs are a runner’s best friend). Timing of when you eat/when you run is hard to fine tune for a lot of runners and I think what’s ideal can vary from person to person. But make sure you’ve eaten in a reasonable time before and after you go run. If you want to see if this is an issue, have a glass of juice as soon as you get back from a run and see how you feel after ten minutes or so. If you feel better, you need more carbs (and possibly even more food overall).",

A couple things that really helped me:\n\n1. Pick a training program and stick to it religiously. I used Hal Higdon's novice 1 and it worked really well for me. Don't skip your long runs. You can miss a mid-week run or two, but don't mess with the long runs. If you do the plan, you'll be ready. Trust your training.\n\n2. Figure out your bathroom plans. It sucks but it's apparently part of this crazy sport. Try to be completely \"empty\" before the race. I generally eat a pretty high fiber diet, but I learned to avoid fiber for 24 hours before a long run. I ate all carbs and no fiber for 48 hours before my race. (I learned from some unfortunate experiences during my long runs that this was the way for me personally to avoid craptastrophes. And no, that is not a typo.) When I get nervous it goes right to my stomach, so I popped two pepto bismol pills at the start line and carried immodium with me. \n\n3. Don't worry about what anyone else is doing. Just do what feels good for you. \n\n4. Make sure you're fueling during your long runs and any runs over an hour. I'm very slow, and I need to have fuel every 45 minutes or so. Experiment with food options - I eventually settled on mini stroopwaffels, clif bloks, and science in sport gels. (Fuel in general - you will need to eat more when you're running a lot.) DO NOT eat anything new on race day. Your stomach will thank you. Drink lots of water, especially on days you run. I like liquid IV after a particularly long/sweaty run (it weirdly helps me avoid overexertion headaches) but water is a basic necessity.\n\n4. Don't get wrapped up in your time or performance - just enjoy the experience! I had such a fantastic time at my first race. The energy of the crowd and the random people who will be cheering for you the whole way gives you such a boost. I made sure to take it all in. At mile 10 I knew that was the farthest I'd ever gone, and as hard as those last few miles were, I enjoyed all of it.

If you can run 14kms cruising on that, it’s not threshold. \n\nYour watch’s VO2 max is inaccurate and a deeply unhelpful metric. Do not base your fitness on this.

I have no idea what you are going through injury-wise but the reason I suggest the physical therapist is because they may be able to get you back out there sooner than expected AND be stronger for it. \n\nWe've made so many strides in understanding injuries in recent years and the old \"RICE\" methods are only helpful in the first day or two post injury. For many injuries (again - I don't know what you have going on so this might not apply) working on mobility, strength and imbalances in the affected area can help you heal faster and have less risk of injury in the future. They will also give you very clear parameters of what you can do, what not to do and when to back off or increase load safely so you feel confident and won't lose too much strength.",

Ive been running consistently for years but I’m sidelined with injuries every few months despite doing physio, eating well, strength training a TONNE and keeping my volume low.\n\nMentally the best way I find to deal with it is seeing each injury as a learning curve and a chance to strengthen your body in other ways. Put as much effort into your rehab exercises as you would with running. Get your heart rate up by going on the elliptical or swimming or cycling, whatever you can do with your injury. \n\nEvery time I’ve been injured I’ve come back fitter. Even after 8 weeks off completely once, without any Crosstraining except cycling to work, I was back to running a 27 min 5k within a few weeks of returning to running (my PR before that was 25:30). A couple of months later I got it down to sub-25. \n\nI’d also recommend reading Lauren Freshman’s book “good for a girl”, it’s about her experience as an elite female athlete. She got injured pretty much every time she was due for a career-defining race. It’s so relatable and heartbreaking but it’s a reminder that even the best athletes regularly have to take months off at a time. \n\nAnother tip I have: take some time to figure out what causes your injuries the most. For me, it’s speedwork. The second I run fast I get bone stress injuries. Which sucks cos I love going fast, but my body can’t handle it and needs to do long, slow runs instead. For some people, they can handle speed but not volume.\n\nMy final injury tip is to book a race for 6-12 months away from now. focus on taking the rest time you need, knowing that you’re then going to rebuild and make your comeback at that race. Don’t be too ambitious with the timeline, as you don’t want to have to pull out if you’re not trained, but it will give you something to focus on and make the rest seem worthwhile :)",

If you're able, cycling/spinning can also help you maintain your aerobic fitness.

Since November 2023, I’ve been focussing a lot on strength training and I’d say I weight about 110lbs right now. I don’t own a scale and only get weighed when a doc weighs me. Anyway. At 102lbs, my thighs were rubbing and sometimes chaffing while running last summer. At 110lbs, they’re rubbing much more frequently and I avoid chaffing by applying Body Glide regularly.\n\nNobody in their right mind would say that I have any weight to loose. Many would say that I have room to gain some. I’m tiny. I have the pelvis width of a prepubescent girl: I’d have to be severely underweight for my thighs not to touch and rub when I run. \n\nThe same thing goes for the armpits/around the bra line. I have no fat there. I’m also a member of the itsy-bitsy-titties committee: If I lie on my back, my boobs disappear. But, sports bra are tight and cut weird sometimes. They squeeze the skin, push it out where it wouldn’t normally be and since I do hold my arms close to my body when running, it creates friction and chaffing. Again, generous amounts of Body Glide help with that.\n\nAll that to say, rubbing and chaffing when running is perfectly normal for women of all sizes. I’d recommend going on YouTube and Instagram and looking up Phily Bowden. She’s an elite runner. In many of her videos and reels where she gets ready for a run, you’ll see her applying Body Glide generously. In one of her YouTube race recap videos, I *think* it’s the one about the Copenhagen marathon, there’s even a bit about her forgetting to pack her Body Glide and absolutely needing to find some before her race. She’s tiny. Nobody in their right mind would say that she has any weight to lose. Yet, she has skin and skin rubs while running. She needs Body Glide, just like we all do!",

Sometimes I need a neutral party to do that for me -so here are a few things that might help you reframe this.\n\nChafing doesn’t happen only to fat people. It happens from moisture and/or friction and can happen anywhere on one’s body in those conditions. Add the humidity and heat of summer and we’re all lucky to not come home chafed everywhere! Men’s (and some women) nipples chafe and bleed during long runs. It’s definitely not due to having fat nipples (look at how slender most marathon runners are). And thighs rubbing together doesn’t actually mean anything about ones size -whether thighs will rub has more to do with the width of your pelvic bone and how your femurs are positioned on it. It’s due to bone structure and there are many women whose thighs will never NOT rub together no matter their body fat due the way their bones are situated. Even if your thighs don’t normally rub together, if you wear a pair of shorts that have too much loose fabric they will ride up during a run and the fabric will now rub on your thighs, add heat and moisture and you’ve got chafing. This has nothing to do with the size of your body and is just something that happens to runners of all sizes and shapes at different times.",

Also your issues could be caused by things getting out of whack a while ago and then the habit solidifying, not anything you're doing wrong now.\n\n2. The most important thing for me is to enforce consistent bedtime and wake up time. If I wake up in the middle of the night, I can read on my kindle (with orange backlight) or listen to podcasts, but I can't get up and start doing stuff. By the way, this is a very challenging process--it can be quite hard to lie there for 5 hours or whatever, but I don't think there's a way around it. Line up some good books and podcasts and work on keeping your self-talk during this time supportive, compassionate, and positive. Therapy books or therapy could help with this. \n\n3. I find listening to podcasts better for falling back asleep than reading, because it removes the decision about when to put the book down. I'll often queue up hours of podcasts (at x0.8 speed and not-too-loud volume), stick my phone under my pillow, and just listen until I fall back asleep.\n\n4. Recently I've implemented 10 minutes of meditation before bed and I think this has been helping a bit, especially after busy/highe-energy days. I think the most important thing is avoiding racing thoughts at bedtime and my hope is that meditation controls this. You said you haven't had success with this and that's totally valid too. \n\n5. You've probably already tried all this, but make sure you're doing standard sleep hygiene stuff like avoiding blue light, limiting caffeine, avoiding sugary food before sleep, making your bedroom comfortable and cold, etc. \n\n6. I haven't had much success with meds/etc.",

If there is nothing new or different in your life, talking to a doctor or a sports medicine practitioner might be worthwhile.

He recommends running by perceived effort. It took me a while to develop that intuition, though, so you could use HR training (when using the correct zones) as a general guide as you figure out your different effort levels. But ultimately, I think running by feel instead of getting stuck on numbers has helped me be a more successful athlete. \n\nAnother good rule of thumb to pay attention to is that easy days should be done at a conversational pace.

However - running slower and longer is still really helpful! Instead of being worried about the exact heart rate, I would go based on feel and not worry about the pace either.

If not while carrying the child, what would life potentially look like afterward? I have heard the hormones associated with pregnancy can speed up cancer, but I have no clue if that is true. Worst case scenario,- is it (financially, emotionally) doable to have cancer and a young child? This sounds like I am being negative; I am not trying to be. I am emphasizing knowing potential risks and then deciding if they are worth it or not. \n\n3. Eat Pray Love has a line in the movie that says something like, \"Having a child is like getting a face tattoo.\"  I don't need to have a child to know that being a mother is a huge responsibility, one that marks you.

Bc. \n\nFor a year I struggled to lose more weight, felt incredibly anxious and stressed all the time despite loving my life alot, I talked to my doctor about it and she said it was definitely NOT the bc.

Since then I've dropped 3 pounds and my average mile time dropped by 45 seconds (again I am a slow anyway so).\n\nBut overall I have been able to focus at work better, I feel so mentally sharp and clear, I have tons of energy and I'm not as hungry as I was. I was also having a hard time getting to sleep this past year, my heart would race out of nowhere (probably anxiety), now I have no issues snoozing. And any anxiety issues I was having in the part year have disappeared.\n\nIt's worth trying for a few months to see how you feel.

The reasoning behind this is that those little breaks keeps your effort level more towards the floor of your zone 2, and prevents you from drifting into a higher intensity - so that your aerobic base gets the maximum beneficial adaptation with minimal exhaustion.",

Many of my injuries were probably caused by starting to run too far too quickly after injury instead of easing back into it...In a weird way injury is also a good time to discover that there are other types of exercise which you might also enjoy very much and thats great because then you are not SO dependent on running anymore. If I get injured again now it won't be so bad for me because I know there are other types of exercise that I could do then which I will enjoy also!\nGood luck and just remember this too shall pass!",

What has helped me with rest days (and nutrition, and mobility etc) specifically is thinking about it as support for my overall training. If running is the priority, it's a prong that I can control to help me achieve my goals.\n\nFrom a more scientific standpoint -\n\nYou are adding stress to your body. Your body doesn't know you are walking up a steep hill vs running. All it knows is that you're adding stress to your system right now. The goal is to make adaptation occur so your body can handle more. I think of the body as a funnel. You add in stress; the rate in which you recover (+ your recovery tools like sleep, REST days, food etc) allow the stress to flow out. Now the goal is for your body to increase the size of this funnel so you can handle more stress. But if you're constantly putting stress in, there's no opportunity for this 'funnel' to switch out. It's just forever being filled and overfilled.\n\n[This](https://storage.googleapis.com/msidt_csuf/Training%20Load%20(IDT%20505)/assets/9Rqa7F0IViNujx1B_Gytmz6nScNy0-d3L.jpg) is an image I made for a learning course on this.\n\nAnyway, that's helped me.

It’s a really hard thing to cope with, and lots of people talk about ‘active recovery’ and I have a tendency to use that as an excuse to swim on a ‘rest day’. But for some of us, particularly with this background, proper rest days are so important. However I’ve been finding the thought of it is worse than the reality! \n\nThere’s a few things I’ve been trying to consider/remind myself of when resting more which might help you:\n\n1. Progress and growth comes when you push yourself out of your comfort zone. For some that’s training, for others that’s resting. By challenging yourself to do the hard thing and take rests and sitting with the discomfort you’ll be growing more resilient and teaching your brain that you can do the hard things.\n\n2. From a physical perspective, adaptation is inhibited by improper rest. In short if you’re not properly rested and recovered it’s pointless to train as you won’t make any gains (strength, speed or endurance). \n\n3. Think about the life you want to lead. If someone close to you makes spontaneous plans do you want to say no because you can’t get your work out in? Do you want to be anxious about holidays or travel days because you might able limited on movement? Or do you want to be flexible and free to do what you truly want. \n\n4. A reminder that you are more than your body. More than how it looks or how it moves. Your value and worth comes from you as a person, a friend, a family member etc. In fact I’m sure if you asked those closest to you why they value you it wouldn’t be for being a runner or hiker! I can have a guess that you’re extremely compassionate to others, and I suspect they’d maybe wish you’d show the same compassion towards yourself. \n\n5. It’s easy for some of us to fall into black and white thinking. But when you’ve been through ED recovery you know how much beauty and peace there is in the grey. And if you got there with food you CAN get there with exercise too. If you push you can get through it and enjoy a free and flexible approach. I have faith that you (and I for that matter!) can get there. One step at a time.\n\nSending lots of positive vibes your way!",

I didnt go for therapy (though I definitely looked into it and was ready to make an appointment), but it got to a point where my body just had enough and I had to be brave enough to face the fact that I was getting older and undereating and overtraining wasn't gonna cut it anymore. (I've made a post touching on the struggles I had in this sub before, you can see my post history :)) my husband provided alot of support, and he's probably the reason I didn't end up making the appointment with the therapist. So do give yourself the time to find someone you can work with and who will truly support you, that's important. \n\nI'm in my late 30s now. Towards the end of the pandemic, I ruthlessly cut out running for a month or so. I was sick of it anyway by that time, so it wasn't that big a deal. Focused on other exercise, Youtube aerobics, hiit, spin.. But I was so sad that I got to a point where I was sick of running, because I really enjoy it. My resolution for 2023 was thus to get to the end of the year in a good mental and physical space to be able to head out and enjoy the cool end year weather on long runs. I'm glad to say I made it :)\n\nAll this to say - what you're feeling now can be overcome, give yourself time. Recognising these issues is the first step and already takes a lot of courage, well done for being honest with yourself.\nIt's not that easy to undo years of negative thoughts, and there are days where I still find myself caring a bit too much about whether I've exercised vs what I ate that day, feelings of guilt and just feeling plain bad that I didn't get out there and move. But I daresay it affects me less and less as time goes on.  \n\nI wish you all the best!

I was planning to do a century ride for my birthday but the air quality was bad enough that I had to call it early. It took a little while, but I had to come to terms that I can't control the weather. Usually when I'm struggling with something like this I go back to the serenity prayer(which I'm not remotely religious, but it helps give perspective). But it's this, \"God grant me the serenity To accept the things I cannot change; Courage to change the things I can; And wisdom to know the difference.\" \n\nIt helps, I can't change that the weather made it dangerous  but I can change how I react to it. So I dug into understanding why it was canceled. It led me to the Chicago 2007 marathon where they had to cancel mid race. Even knowing it was hot and taking extra precautions, they still weren't equipped to support racers. They were running out of cups at water stations, medical tents were flooded, they called in 30 additional ambulances and AC buses. And still wasn't enough. Runners world had an article that basically said, the competence of the medical staff prevented a catastrophe. Reading that article helped me see the whole picture of what could have happened. The thing is the EAS was created because of that marathon. To ensure what happened that day didn't happen again because it was so close to being very bad. \n\nI then put myself in the shoes of the people who made that decision, and I get a pit in my stomach. Knowing the backlash, the work the next few days and just having to send that email knowing that you're crushing peoples spirit, no one wants that job. I know the president of one of the charities. He is the nicest guy. I pictured him having to tell people who already face added challenges in life that this is another thing they can't do, broke me. I sent him an email just saying thanks for the work him and his team have done and the amazing things they did the day before and that everyone went home safe so we can do it again.  He sent me an email on Monday telling me that he went back to that email 7 times because he needed a pick me up and that a 2 minute email helped make Sunday not so miserable. \n\nEveryone's feelings are valid, and I think most people had really intense feelings of sadness and anger and didn't know how to handle it. \n\nThat being said, I'm running the 10 miles on Sunday. I'll write my unofficial time on my medal and hang it up. Then sign up for it next year.",

You can’t really fight against weather conditions but as temps start to drop your Z2/3 performance will naturally improve by virtue of needing less energy to cool down. The best way to further help this process is to add speedwork, aka playing in very high HR zones for brief spurts. This helps jolt your easy pace downward when it plateaus and it’s great to do in tandem with cooling temps. \n\nOne speed workout a week is really all you need. These don’t need to be crazy. The easiest formula I have is to divide the workout into 3: a 1 mile warmup at an easy pace, intervals, then a 1 mile cool down at an easy pace. Every third workout, I increase the warmup/cool down distance by a half a mile maxing out at 2-4 miles on either side of the intervals. You can temper that however you see fit, I generally don’t let my speed workouts exceed 10 total miles and I only get up to that when I’m deep in marathon training and need the volume. With speed workouts though, your distance endurance should also increase at the same time as your pace dropping. It’s pretty neat!\n\nFor the interval portion itself, there are a couple things you can do in order of intensity from “my first speed workout” to “I don’t hate this anymore!” After your warmup you can do something like:\n- 6 100m strides where you run all out for 100m, then walk/jog 100m 6 total times. Once this starts to feel easy, increase to 7 reps, then 8. \n-  6 1:00 minutes intervals. Run hard for a minute then jog to recover for a minute. Repeat 6 times. As this gets easier increase the duration up to 2-3 minute intervals, or add more reps. You can experiment with this\n\nDo one or the other, either time or distance based. If I’m trying to predict total mileage I will stick to distance based. If I’m trying to focus on holding my pace for longer periods of time like before adding tempo workouts to training, I’ll go by time instead. \n\nPro tip, do speed workouts on a track. It’s just easier and safer and more predictable. I have a track in my neighborhood at a local school. I’ll jog around the neighborhood for my warm up and end at the track where I do my interval portion, then cool down around the neighborhood again. If I’m lazy I’ll just drive to the track and do the whole workout on it, but this can get a little boring.",

This will take more exertion and your HR will keep climbing as you keep pushing, so treat it like a workout (i.e., do this once a week, don't abandon low HR running altogether).\n\n- You can also increase endurance by increasing your overall volume while keeping the effort easy. E.g. if you can run/walk 5 miles, you should be able to jog a mile without a break. If you haven't already, add a long run once a week.\n\n- Crosstrain! You can increase the total time you spend in zone 2 with low impact activities like biking and power walking. If you don't feel like you have the time to add these as separate workouts in your week, you can just try to move more throughout your day. Do you have an errand to run that could be done without a car? Can you pace around while on a phone call? \n\n- You _will_ see the gains when it cools off in the fall and it will feel amazing",

Also, when summer comes, I always think about getting out for a lot of easy running, because I ran xc in HS and college.

Familiar aches creeping back. \n\nBut a month in, it feels normal to get up and out the door, 5k is an easy jog, and I'm starting to feel more like myself every day. \n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is, there are two components, in my mind: remember why you love it, and make your plan concrete. There were a couple months when my injury was pretty much better and I was just casually jog-walking when I felt like it, but I never regained any real ease with running that way.

I'm about 20 pounds heavier than I was in my collegiate racing days and don't think it's my bottleneck. 2) I believe that the only way to get better at running is to run.

Even a really short run goes along way to getting your body used to running again. \n\nI love running, but I feel like my progress as an adult is always hindered by the fact that I put my enjoyment of life above my training schedule (and that's a lot of biking, indoor bouldering, hiking with friends who generally don't want to do a tempo run with me).

Sorry for the rant ahead but I worked very hard to get over my phobia and these are the tips I remind myself all the time. Good luck and keep enjoying the trails! \n\n1) Learn about the snakes in your area! Be able to identify them quickly. There's a huge difference between seeing a copperhead vs. a water snake in terms of fucking up my run. Might I recommend visiting the wonderful folks at r/whatsthissnake? I have learned so much about snakes from that sub.\n\nAlso, be able to identify defensive, offensive, and passive body language too. A rattler curled-up, shaking it's tail, head up? Yeah I'm gonna head in the other direction. A rattler slithering by with a full stomach...I feel comfortable to pass without much worry. \n\n2) Snakes DO NOT WANT TO BITE YOU. You are not food. They know they can't eat you. They will almost always try to get away from you, or be scary so that you go away, rather than strike. Even if they do, it's often a dry bite so they can save their venom for actual food. \n\n3) That being said...know what to do in case you do get bite. Google what to do if you get bite by the specific snakes in your area.\n\n4)  Snakes are territorial. If you see one on your trail one day, be aware that it's probably living around there (I think it's a half mile radius?). Also, you're unlikely to see snakes occupying in the same area. So if you see a water, rat, or king snake, it's highly unlikely a rattler will be in the same stretch.\n\n5) Don't use headphones while trail running. For so many reasons. \n\n6) Playing \"Snake or Stick?\" is totally normal. Don't be upset if being scared slows you down a bit. Being safe is way more important than running fast, especially on trails. If it is a snake, either wait for it to slide away, or head in a different direction, if you're not comfortable going around. Once I waited for 10 minutes on a trail for a snake to leave...until other hikers came by and discovered it was a pile of bear scat. Whatever, I felt safe! \n\n7) Snakes are like the rest of us. If it's a cool morning/evening, they're going to be in a sunny spot to get warm. If it's middle of the day hot, they're going to be burrowed under ground, rocks, or in tall grass. If you're scrambling be mindful of where you put your hands.  Keeping on the (clear, not overgrown) trail is always your best bet. \n\nI previously scratched trail runs that I drove hours to if someone even said they \\*think\\* they saw a snake further up on the trail. Now that I've educated myself, I actively look for snakes (I seriously got addicted to r/whatsthissnake )...and yet when I do see them my heart rate still goes nuts and I get scared. It's a natural response and we should be grateful for our own reptilian brains for helping to try keep us safe :)",

Most of the reason why I trail run is so I can experience that wildness and nature. Maybe try reframing how you’re thinking about this. It’s their territory and you’re a guest. We are just afraid of them as they are of us. And many many snake enthusiasts would be overjoyed to see a rattlesnake! Myself included! Try looking at it as a lucky experience and something very few people get to enjoy. \n\nAs others have said - snakes don’t want to bite you. It’s a huge waste of venom for them. Maybe ~50% of bites from adults are dry bites. That’s *not* a reason to take any chances but maybe it’ll make you feel a little safer? \n\nRattlesnakes are very scary because they are literally the most shitted upon snake of the snake world. Basically all other snakes prey on rattlers. And then birds off course. This is one of the reasons they are jumpier snakes and seen as meaner. Idk why but that made me feel a bit bad for them and also less afraid. \n\nProbably really the only advice you actually need is that if there’s a snake blocking your path, spray some of your water or hydration mix on it and it should move. Also snakes in general are most active in the mornings and evenings so trying to run in the afternoon will probably help you avoid them best. \n\nIf you DO get bit, DO NOT apply a tourniquet. Stay calm, elevate the bite wound, get to the hospital ASAP. Remove all tight clothes and all jewelry. Avoid moving quickly or at all if possible. If you have a marker or something mark the bite area and continue doing so every 15 minutes to track the progression. Do not try and suck out the venom. Do NOT try and cut out the venom. DO NOT let the hospital do that either - if they try to then call a snake bite expert. \n\nAll snakes in the US (except coral snakes) use the same antivenom so you don’t need to try and identify the snake past “rattlesnake.” I’d call your closest hospital and ask if they have antivenom on site. Might even be helpful to tell them you’re a regular trail runner and that you often see rattlers and just want them to be aware. If they do not have antivenom then you may need to contact your local zoo. DO NOT try and catch the snake and take it with you for ID purposes. Knowing it’s a rattler is enough and trying to catch or kill it will most likely result in another bite. \n\nIf you have any specific questions my DMs are open and I’d encourage visiting any of the many snake subreddits!

A backpacker had come down to fill his water and saw me/just happened to be in the right place and fast/strong enough to grab me and pull me out.\n\nApparently I was so freaked out for my dog that, after stripping me/wrapping me in everything he had, he ran up the trail armed with a gun to look for my dog. He came back with her, and said that it was actually another dog, who had attacked us. He had found the dog still on top of mine and the owner just standing there sobbing, doing nothing. Thankfully, my dog came to the guy and only had surface wounds. \n\nI was all cut up and bleeding from everywhere, but surprisingly only fractured my left hand. And, of course, my mind. \n\nIt took an entire year of therapy to feel comfortable and happy on the trail again. I didn't really enjoy running, for a long time, but refused to stop. But that's sort of the way I am, in general, in life. \n\nTldr - it's ok if you are broken right now, I get you and have been where you are. Maybe switching to other surfaces would help, maybe not.

I got back out a couple of weeks later for a gentle run and was obviously much slower but feeling determined to get back to where I was... then three weeks later I got it again. This illness was much more mild, only a cold really but it utterly tanked my stamina. It was weeks until I could run again and when I did I got so breathless and my heart rate would shoot up. I had to drop to \"running\" two miles twice a week.\n\nThree months later and I think I'm finally back to where I was last autumn, if not a little fitter.

I improved rapidly as a runner when I ran my miles ridiculously slowly. Like, shuffling along. Walk breaks are great! Slow down way, way more than you think you need to. Pain and fatigue are just signals from your body, not failures. You will learn when you can push through them but for right now, maybe don't. I don't come from a competitive athletic background but I know that requires a lot of pushing yourself, so if you competed swimming you know you have it in you already when you need it. I would listen to what your legs are telling you for now. 2 miles is a lot longer than most people can run and you'll get better if you keep showing up.\nI also got a lot of benefit from strength training, fwiw.

Though I do think your situation might be slightly unique - my guess is that your heart/lungs can handle the amount of running you're doing right now (good aerobic fitness from swimming), but your legs can't yet. Which is why you feel like you can breathe easily, but your legs are tired and fatigued. The impact of running is very different from what your legs experience while swimming. It will take time for your legs to build up the strength and the stamina needed for running, and to \"catch up\" to your baseline level of aerobic fitness that you have from swimming. \n\nI think you would really benefit from following a structured training plan. I highly recommend checking out \"Couch to 5k\"!\n\nAnd in terms of \"pushing yourself\", my advice would be to *not* push yourself. Ideally you should be keeping things easy. But instead of running as much as you can and then walking when you have to, a better approach would be to just do run/walk intervals from the start, so that you don't get so fatigued, and are able to accumulate more total running time, and more total time on your feet. This is how \"Couch to 5k\" is structured. And also just to point out, you don't have to start at week 1, you can jump into whatever week you think matches your fitness level best!",

Should I just let myself walk if I want to? Will I still get better if I do that?\n\nI don't think you're pushing yourself too much. That comes out more as injuries and pain. People will say all sorts of things about pausing to walk but you won't know if it hurts your performance until you have more of your personal stats. I personally love to crash in cold grass when i do long runs on hot days - it's just an awesome feeling. I would literally lie flat and not care about my HR. After a while i get the urge to get up and continue my run and yeah, most of the time it will not be particularly good but in aggregate I keep improving, just more slowly than folks who power through.\n\nThe most important thing in fitness is finding something that you can sustain long term. If you need to pause for walks in order to maintain running as part of your lifestyle, then do it. If you feel bad about walking and not improving fast enough, you'll sour on running eventually which is the worst possible outcome.\n\nGood luck, I hope you stick with it!",

Hydrate lots, make sure you're eating lots of protein to help rebuild those muscles, do some yoga and foam rolling to help with the muscle tightness, I find that epsom salt baths are also great when you're feeling really tight.\n\nAfter that-- I imagine you can probably hop right back on track with the training plan you were on before! You know now that you can do the distance, so now you can work on doing it stronger and faster. If your plan is based primarily on distance, you might find it helpful to build some speed work sessions in-- \"strong before long\" is generally a good approach.",

I don't have the time to reply to everyone's individual comment (as in click reply one by one), I'll try to do so here:\n\n1. Tri/du/biathlon - I actually toyed with this idea for a while. I'm a terrible swimmer though, and I know I can't commit the time to getting good enough at swimming to just not drown in the open water. There's the duathalon, but cycling here kinda sucks. For context I live in a small Asian city state (not difficult to guess where, haha) and the mental energy needed to get out for cycling here I personally feel is .. mental. You're constantly battling traffic, and during the pandemic cycling really took off and so did the number of annoying pelotons on the road and the number of road accidents. Someone from my running club whom I don't know literally got killed riding one week before the race I dropped out of last year. These may sound like excuses (:p) but running (and swimming) have the lowest barriers to entry here. So maybe it's time to make time to get to the pool...? \n\n2. Trail running- yes I do a fair bit of it! But again because I live in aforesaid small Asian city state, options are somewhat limited and the trail is pretty technical, lots of rocks and tree roots when sometimes you just want some unbroken stretches of packed mud, yknow? Rocks and tree roots are fine but when it's not really broken up by packed mud it's also kinda a mindf**k. That said, I think it'll be good for me to increase my time on the trails so I am going to do that. I think the rocks and tree roots bothered me because I was worried about what it would look like on Strava, I'm sure it'll be different now I'm not on anymore/not using my GPS watch. \n\n3. Therapy - so last year after I faced my burnout, I actually sought recommendations for a therapist - specifically for disordered eating (I'm sure running and motherhood would have come up too though, haha.) It came down to that OR a couple sessions dry needling to fix my niggle. After some discussion with my husband I went with the dry needling. So far I think it was the right decision, but I'm not closed to the idea of seeing someone to just talk it out. \n\n4. Technology- I'm currently heading out with only an analog old school Casio. Needed coz I don't wanna be late for work ;) haha. But I don't turn on the stopwatch, I literally use the watch to just... tell the time. \n\n5. Finding another hobby/something else to be competitive about - I've got many (I daresay healthy) hobbies, and after I saw the comment on this I brought it up to my friends and concluded shortly after  that I was quite liable to turn them into unhealthy hobbies if I got competitive about it??? But then again, is it possible to get competitive about embroidery or cross-stitch or reading? Lol\n\n6. Relationship with running/reframing - the words I used to describe to people how I felt when I stopped running were \"I desperately wanted to get back to the time when times didn't matter and I liked getting out there for its own sake\". Realistically though, that was probably about a decade ago, and in that time social media has exploded, and if I want to continue social media use - which honestly I do, I like the social aspect and I like sharing and reading funny and cute things - it's going to be impossible to cut all running media and friends out completely. \n\nBut my conclusion was that this was really something I wanted badly enough - and to a large extent, it's up to me and my mindset. It is tough though and I spend alot of time also just kinda bemused at how much I struggle and how it seems so easy for Everyone Else. Ha ha. \n\n7. Doing something cool like a self-supported multi-day hike trek sort of thing - this is definitely something husband and i have a vague idea we will do one day (overseas) but with his work and the kids, it's gonna have to wait for a bit. I must say though that this is one of the things that is currently motivating me to keep running- I want to stay in good enough shape to be able to jump into something like this with say half a year's notice. \n\nRunning is definitely an ultra journey, and i want to be a running granny if I'm blessed enough to get to that stage of life.

So it forces the runner to focus on other things like effort, technical skill, the mental game, fueling, etc.  And those are things that you can succeed in regardless of how fast or slow you are.

About two years ago, I was feeling the strongest I’d been as a runner, hitting big miles week after week and enjoying challenging myself on trails, while also incorporating some runs on flatter paths to work on speed. I’ve never been fast but I used to be able to easily hit paces that are 3-5 minutes faster than I can now. \n\nI ended up with an ankle injury in April 2021 and had to step back with the running a bit while I worked with a PT and tried to heal while slowly building back up to being able to run double digit miles. Since the injury, my paces have never really been the same though and over the last year, I’ve somehow slowed even more. It’s frustrating to feel like I’m putting so much work in and not seeing results, especially when I compare myself to others who run way lower mileage than me and are still faster. \n\nHowever, I’ve tried to find joy in running outside of my pace. I had never raced before last year and I decided I really wanted to train for a tough trail marathon for my first race. Training through an Arizona summer was a struggle but race day I felt so good, even though I was slow, and that lit a fire under me and made me realize I can do hard things. I’m now training for my first ultra and trying to focus more on time on feet rather than my pace. I really enjoy finding new trails to explore and that’s what keeps it fun for me. I am still struggling a lot to consider myself a runner when I feel like I’m slower than ever and hiking more than running — most of the trails where I live now are pretty technical and I’m not good at running on rocky trails — but I like having something else to focus on that takes my mind off my pace. Just being out in beautiful places gives me gratitude for everything my body can do.\n\nI hope you can find a way to bring the joy back to running!",

I think the worst part was a 10-12ish year old boy coming up to me and asking “Are you ok, ma’am?”  Felt about 100 years old that day!

On particular day, I was at mile 3 and was feeling so good that I decided to add some distance that day. BUT there was a dead cat on the sidewalk.  I'm a cat lover and a cat momma. I think I closed my eyes and tried to keep running and I fell off the sidewalk.  \n\nBefore I knew it, I was on the ground and various things hurt a lot. It's hard to figure out right away how bad things are. I didn't know it right away, but I had a sprain that was bad enough to crack a little bone in my ankle. I had a big scrape on my elbow, but I could barely feel that compared to my ankle.  \n\nMy ankle started swelling and hurting fast, and I couldn't walk on it. I had been listening to music on my phone via headphones. I knew I needed to get my husband to pick me up before he left for work, so I dialed him right away but I didn't have a microphone on the headphones so I couldn't hear him and he couldn't properly hear me. I was saying, \"I need help. I need help\" and it was loud enough that he could sort of hear me but not really. He thought I was being abducted. I eventually unplugged the headphones and was able to tell him that I was hurt and where I was. He picked me up. I had to hop on my good leg to get to where he was able to park. \n\nThen urgent care and an x-ray and a big boot for a long time and an orthopedist and eventually surgery and lots and lots of physical therapy. I just ran my first 4+ mile run again last Sunday over 3 years later. Don't let that scare you. It turns out I had sprained my ankle lots of times without knowing it and kept going, which meant I was using the wrong muscles for the movements. Then the surgery and recovery overburdened my good ankle, which had also probably been sprained a good number of times (I am a little on the hyperflexible side), so I didn't have good mechanics and needed to work on that. It's been a process but I'm very glad to be able to run again! I thought maybe those days were behind me. I'm definitely doing more cross-training now. \n\nI have a treadmill for inclement weather and if I'm running outside, I share my location with my husband. Just in case! \n\nBe safe out there!",

Taking a little break allows you to fully recover from all the training you've been doing and come back stronger. I'd suggest taking a week or two off, then taking two weeks to build back up -- 1/3 of your normal weekly mileage for a week, then 2/3, then back to normal.

I also love changing things up, so sometimes I’ll go to my gym and do a workout there instead of running.\n\nOn days when my mental health is good, I try to push myself to go on longer runs. On days when my mental health isn’t good, walking my dog is sometimes all I can do. I think meditation and therapy really helped me discern what are uncomfortable feelings and emotions I can push through, and what are days where I really just can’t go for a run. And that’s okay!\n\nAt the height of my bipolar diagnosis, I found running groups help. I also like doing monthly running challenges knowing that some days are going to be better than others in a month and so it’s still reasonable for me to meet my goal or do the challenge.\n\nSending love ❤️you got this!",

Social identities (see Tajfel and Turner for theory) is a person’s sense of who they are based on their group membership(s). Tajfel (1979) proposed that the groups (e.g. social class, family, football team etc.) which people belonged to were an important source of pride and self-esteem. Groups give us a sense of social identity: a sense of belonging to the social world. We divide the world into “them” and “us” based through a process of social categorization (i.e. we put people into social groups). There is research that shows that when one of our social identities become salient, it gives us a framework or lens to look at the world from and evaluate. The manipulation used of the Three things has been used in other research, and works by making us think about our social identity. This current study was interested in if the lens we use effects our behavior, safety and perceived stress. It also wanted to control for previous experience of harassment. ---I hope this comment helps to explain the ideas behind the study and why certain questions were used - Lisa",

I’m so confused. \n\nSo you’re saying cipro can affect your Achilles for up to 6 months after you take it, and then after 6 months your achillies should be fine again?? \n\nAnd is there any medication or something you need to do to help heal your achillies tendons? \n\nThis is so rough as I’m such an active guy - any suggestions of other sports you could do? Maybe biking is ok? \n\nFunny enough I’m reading this because I was JUST about to start a second dose of cipro for my same issue originally taken for, and now I’m learning the first cipro back in October is prob what has caused my achillies to be so sore. \n\nThanks for any wisdom or words of comfort.. feeling pretty down about it all.",

So at the level you're doing now, you need to replace about 700-800 calories. Depending on how long your run takes and whether you can eat a proper meal before it (I can't, I have like a poptart at most before running) you also may have skipped or be due for a meal anyway. So make sure your recovery calories are enough.\n\nI always found it worked best to refuel *immediately* with a drink with highly available carbs and some protein, like chocolate milk, and then after the shower, split the rest between two meals. The first meal is focused on quality carbs like whole grains and fruits, the second meal is focused on protein and micros. Healthy fats can go in either or both. So for example I would make a nice overnight oats bowl with Greek yogurt the night before, and top it with fruit and nuts after my shower. Then an hour or two later after digesting a bit, I'd make scrambled eggs with lots of vegetables or a dense salad topped with salmon. Catching up most of my calories by dinnertime with nutrient dense foods helped me feel bright the next day and at no point ravenous. \n\nAlso, if you're not fueling *during* your runs, this is around the point you should start. For 6 miles or less,  I usually don't take anything. Between 7-10 I'll take one gel and eat it around the 3-4 mile mark (it takes about 20 minutes to kick in, so plan accordingly). Over 10 miles I will start having that poptart beforehand, and have a gel every 4 miles ish, keeping in mind the onset time.\n\nFoam rolling is great, and I suggest puttering around with Yoga With Adriene.

My interval workouts go from 400m repeats to 1 mile repeats, which helps me to build up to *sustaining* speed, and I find that this is extremely helpful for the mental effort of the tempo run. On the other hand, running enough easy miles throughout the week gives my body the mileage base I need to have confidence in the tempo run.\n\nNow that I've been doing a regular weekly tempo run of 6-10 miles for a few years, I realize that the key to a good tempo run is just to lock in a pace and stay there. At first, most of this is mental effort (it always feels easy for the first half mile-1 mile, but the key is staying dialed in when it starts to feel hard). For me, what helps with this is to make tempo runs special in some way. I do my tempo runs on Thursdays, which is also the day my favorite podcast comes out, so it's basically a special treat where I get to listen to my favorite podcast and do my tempo run.

No, it won't be like a continuation of when you were running multiple times a week, but it also won't be like starting from scratch.\n\nI took some time off from running recently because I started a new job and my schedule makes it really hard to get runs in regularly. Before that, I was also running about 4 times a week, usually about 10K and working on getting my pace down. I went back out for my first run in a long time yesterday and had the same fears as you- it's going to feel like starting all over, it's going to be so disheartening to not be able to run the way I was before, my pace is going to be slow, my knees are going to hurt, I'm not going to enjoy it and I'm going to want to stop, etc, etc.\n\nIt wasn't nearly as bad I thought it would be. I ran 10K with a few brief walking breaks. My pace was slow. I feel kind of sore today. But it was definitely better than nothing, and if I keep making the time, I know I can get back to where I was. Or maybe I won't. But I am capable of continuing to run, I still enjoy it, it helps me sleep, and it's a great workout.\n\nSo my advice would be to put no expectations on your first few runs. Just accept that those runs are going to be what they're going to be- and their main purpose is to give you valuable information about where you're at so you have a starting point. Even if the run is \"bad,\" it's better than no run.",

Fibular stress fractures are rare because it’s not a weight bearing bone, it’s for stability. So it usually points to a gait problem that’s going to continue to cause injuries like over pronation since you repeatedly loaded a non-weight bearing bone enough to get a stress fracture. You also want to make sure it’s fixed correctly so you don’t get different problems which is why I suggested a PT because they have considerably more training than someone at a shoe store and you really don’t want to gamble on #3. \n\nYou’ll get through this.

You might consider doing a 5k time trial (TT) if you don’t have a race time from the past 6 months. I raced a 10k in April at 7:41/mile and my easy runs fall naturally in the 9:15-9:45 range. It’s also possible that your body hasn’t learned how to vary speeds well. This takes a few weeks to learn because you are increasing your fast twitch muscles with short sprints and building an aerobic base with conversational pace runs. Some people like HR as a better measure but make sure you use a chest strap as wrist monitors can be wildly inaccurate at times. For me HR training drove me nuts because it took me away from just running an intuitive pace. When I came back to running postpartum earlier this year I was running at 12-13 minute pace and felt like I might as well be speed walking. But after about two weeks my HR settled and I was able to run faster. I hope that helps!!\n\n\nEdit: I will also add that it is always always better to run too slow in the beginning so you don’t risk burnout or injury. The majority of people (in my limited experience and myself included early in my running journey) run their easy runs at a moderate pace instead of an easy pace because running slow is actually hard. It should feel like a 3 or 4 effort and like you could run that pace for a couple hours.",

The aid stations are as much a mental break as a physical break. There’s also a big difference between a training run and a full effort DIY race attempt. That’s mostly mental, but it’s real. \n\nSo, don’t beat yourself up! This is still an achievable goal for you, and you’ve already done the bulk of the work. I don’t know anyone who hasn’t had a bad race, and I’d bet very few ultra runners have zero DNFs on the books. As in so many things in life, failure is part of the process. \n\nOne suggestion: find a running community. You’re here, so that’s a great start! I know it saves face to tell fewer people, but the support you can get from running friends (or at least familiar running strangers online) is really invaluable. I never considered myself capable of a half marathon, much less an ultra, before I started interacting with other runners. \n\nMore tactical: to cope and move on, try again. Try a couple training runs with a different hydration strategy, or if you have one that works well, ask yourself whether you might have psyched yourself out during your race and not followed through on it. There may be specific things that went wrong (hydration, nutrition, phase of your cycle, flat shoes...) and can be tweaked, but also consider that maybe it was just a bad day.

While I didn't succeed in the race, I tried super hard and my muscles and joints need a couple weeks off. I think rest and food and stretching now can set the framework for future runs. And even if the run didn't go the way I hoped, the training was wonderful. I loved the structure and getting to run 5 days a week. \n\nAnyway, I just share to say: hey, we all have bad runs.

(oh, get a small band like is pictured in the standing leg raise exercise if you don't already have one - a pack with different strength bands should be a  cheap purchase, and will let you start out with a light band and then move up. Super great for the kind of strength work you should be doing as a runner)\n\nAside from that, try videoing yourself running.  If you're landing with a straight knee with your foot ahead of your hips, that's pretty tough on your knee-you're sending the impact shock straight up all your joints.  If you're landing with a soft knee with your foot below your hips, you're using your leg muscles as as a shock absorber and that's a lot gentler on your joints-though it can feel like more muscular work!\n\nEdit: of course as the other commenter said, I can't actually diagnose you so can't speak to your specific knee issue, but  these things are really good for any runner to be doing, and are great general knee issue preventatives-if all runners did these things, physical therapists' offices would be a lot emptier.",

Started at 20 minutes of barely jogging and added distance VERY slowly (like 2 2k runs a week and 1 3k). \n\n-better nutrition: eating more protein, veggies, vitamin and mineral supplements to hit anything I’m missing in my daily intake\n\n-yoga once a week \n\n-stretching after EVERY run. There is a distinct difference between if I do and don’t stretch.\n\n-barefoot running shoes- a lot of my issues come from my feet not liking my fancy padded running shoes, especially my ankles\n\n-running form: I used to run “knock kneed” with my knees and hips bent towards midline. Focusing on lifting each leg straight up to run eliminated a lot of my knee pain\n\n-drinking enough water- keeps my muscles from hurting \n\n-knowing when to stop. I know we all like to be ambitious and push ourselves but if you feel a *hint* of pain (not fatigue, but sharp or aching pain) STOP. If you stop early enough, take an anti-inflammatory that night and take a day or two off minor injuries usually heal quick. More you run on an injury the longer it’ll take to heal\n\n-judicious use of support wraps/braces. I personally use the Back on Track wraps/braces. I have found that especially when starting back from a break just having something that adds a liiiittle extra warmth and stability to my knees helps to keep them from getting sore. Most of the knee injuries are instability issues so by adding a bit of support until all the inner ligaments and tendons tighten up and balance out you reduce pain and injuries \n\nBest of luck, I almost quit running 2 years ago because I too got hurt EVERY run.

Here's the daily breakdown how I did the 2 different splits:\n\n**PPL/Base Building Split**\n\n* Monday: Push day + yoga/stretching/foam rolling\n* Tuesday: Pull day + shorter easy run\n* Wednesday: Legs + longer easy run (poss. tempo run) \n* Thursday: Push day + X-train/yoga/stretching/foam rolling\n* Friday: Pull day + middle distance easy run \n* Saturday: Legs + long run  \n* Sunday: Short recovery run + yoga/stretching/foam rolling\n\n**Full Body Split**\n\n* Monday: Anterior chain + longer easy run\n* Tuesday: Posterior chain + interval work\n* Wednesday: X-train/yoga/stretching/foam rolling\n* Thursday: Anterior chain + tempo run\n* Friday: Posterior chain + long run (can also swap to Saturday)\n* Saturday: Rest! (can also swap to Friday)\n* Sunday: Short recovery run + yoga/stretching/foam rolling\n\nTo note: These workouts are 2-3 lower-body compounds + 2-3 upper-body compounds + core + some plyo and use much higher weight/lower reps than I was doing previously with the PPL. The PPL was more volume/hypertrophy focused.\n\nI've found I've been able to maintain muscle mass while doing these routines really well as long as I'm getting enough food in. When I don't eat enough, I can tell because I feel like shit and can't hit my paces/lifts. I also focus on trying to get \\~1g protein per lb of body weight. If I feel worn down or like I need an extra rest day I'll take it because I've pushed too hard and gotten injured in the past. So now I'd rather rest for a day than be sidelined for a few months :)",

I try to change up my schedule as I get bored with the same thing over and over, but here are a few tips and rules I use that work for me. \\*DISCLAIMER: I am not a personal trainer or an expert, just a workout junkie.\\*\n\n* Always take a rest day once a week. On rest days you can walk, jog, or do light yoga, but don't do anything that feels hard.\n* Don't do the same activity twice in 24 hours. Preferably 48 hours.\n* If you're training twice on the same day, do the thing that feels harder first.\n* Pick goals. You probably won't be able to train super hard for more than one sport at a time, unless you're 18 and have a personal chef and no responsibilities.\n   * For example, I focus on running in the spring and train for a local 15k in May, cycling in the summer and train for a local century in September, and then weight training and indoor rock climbing in the fall and winter when it's cold outside. While I'm focusing on one thing, I only try to maintain the other things rather than progressing.\n* DRINK WATER. I used to wonder why I felt so fatigued all the time and wasn't progressing even though I was sleeping and eating enough. Water is absolutely necessary for your body to function well and if you're working out a lot you will need more than you might think. I try to fill my water bottle at least 4-5x a day.\n* Listen to your body. If you feel exhausted and are dreading your workout, maybe just rest. (I know this is obvious, but it's really hard for me to do this so I need to be told this all the time haha)\n\nAlso, different things work for different people. It might take some time to figure out what works best for your schedule and your body. I keep a journal and that helped me figure it out. Good luck, you're awesome!!!",

The school might be able to force your parents hands. You need other tools besides running to handle life.\n\nIf you absolutely cannot stop running altogether, I would cut back your mileage, no long runs at all, no speedwork. Until you are healthy you are only running to get your body moving. You can do severe long-term damage to your body if you insist on training through this.\n\nLastly, I just want to say from an internet stranger I'm proud of you for recognizing you have things to work on and taking steps to change.

Then I learned how bad this is for long term health and it scared me, I took a complete break from all planned exercise and ate lots of calories without restriction. My period came back in 6 weeks. \n\nThe first thing I think you should do is order the book \"No Period Now What\" by Nicola Rinaldi. It is the absolute bible for hypothalamic amenorrhea, which is the condition it sounds like you have. While a lot of it is focused on getting pregnant, you can skip those sections and focus on the recovery plan and learning about the physiological mechanisms that cause amenorrhea and why this is so detrimental to your long term health. \n\nI completely get that it feels like running is essential for your mental health, but feeling this way is actually pretty unhealthy for a lot of runners. If running is ruling your life, if you are compulsive about exercise, if you feel like you can only be \"normal\" if you get your run in … well, this is a very restricted form of life and I can promise that things are much better when you are more in control with your relationship with running. \n\nA few other notes: \"weight restored\" doesn't really mean anything if you haven't gotten your period back. The fact that you aren't cycling means that you are still not getting enough calories for your body to feel safe investing in its normal functions, and is conserving energy by shutting down your cycle. When it comes to hypothalamic amenorrhea, there isn't really some minimum weight/BMI/body fat percentage that is sufficient to get your period. Rather, it's a complex relationship between stress, energy burned, calories consumed, and genetic predisposition.\n\nThis is also probably not a great time to focus on gaining muscle—if you're not getting your period, it means your body is so deprived of energy that it's shutting down all non-essential functions just to survive. Stressing your body more by asking it to build muscle when it's already in a weakened state will not help you recover.",

It’s a bit surprising to me that they wouldn’t want you to seek therapy if it’s causing you to be underweight/losing your period....\n\nYou can request to speak with your school counselor or school psychologist - but be sure to ask them to go over their confidentiality practices with you and make sure you understand them. But those people can help you a little, possibly without your parents knowing too much if you are worried about that.\n\nAside from that - if you want to run a 1/2 marathon and feel good about it instead of disappointed... I would encourage you that the proper fueling of your body is what will make you a better runner. Getting the miles in is important but if it can motivate you to eat better - the fuel you give your body is what’s going to allow you to reach your running goals. \n\nWould you be able to start eating small amounts (volume-wise) of more calorie dense foods....to make eating more less stressful? Like avocados or peanut butter...etc. \n\nGood luck - be kind to yourself. If you’re looking to run a 1/2 marathon - you’re determined and strong. You can do it.\n\nEdit: I’m sure you might know this already but...first thing, it’s great that you recognize that you have a problem and are taking small steps to work on it. Second - I’m not trying to scare you or stress you out but this really is something you should take seriously - disorders related to eating/over exercising can become very dangerous.

Of course running can help you lose weight! You just have to be mindful not to eat back what you ran off. \n\nIt takes time to get good at running. If you are starting off with a short run a few times a week you may not burn a ton of calories, but you are still making your legs, core, heart, and lungs stronger.

After finishing 7, I knew I could do 8 the next week. By the time the race came, I was mentally ready for the whole distance.\n\nYou got this!",

When I started training longer distances, I had a hard time forcing myself to slow down on the long runs, which predictably led me to hit the wall earlier than expected on long runs...and repeat.  \n\nWhat helped me was re-conceptualizing some of the advice in training plans. Rather than thinking about individual mileage and stressing over pace, I started thinking about the mileage as something to \"check off of a list,\" so to speak. I know you said you know how to pick a training plan, etc., but I think there might be a way to \"trick\" yourself into sticking with it, so to speak! The beauty of a set training plan is that it'll incorporate different days when you do shorter and longer distances, easier and harder workouts. When I lack motivation (or I just want to go out for a long run, training plan be damned), I try to think about how the \"reward\" for doing the short workout now is that I can have an awesome long run on Saturday. On the flip side, when I'm feeling *really* unmotivated to do a longer run, I think about how my \"reward\" for finishing a long run today is that I can check it off so that I've \"earned\" a shorter run or a rest day the next day. It sounds kind of dumb, but it really helps me get over mental blocks. As a bonus, once you get to week 3 or so, the short runs will actually start feeling \"short,\" even if they don't right now. When I'm feeling shitty mid-run, I do the classic \"if you jog all the way to that stoplight, you can take a 10-second break; okay, if you keep going until the next tree, *then* you can take a break,\" etc. \n\nExample: today is Monday and I don't feel like running at all, but my training plan says \"do 5k.\" My compromise to myself is that I'll let myself go as slow or fast as I want, as long as I hit 5k. Even if I have to stop at million stoplights, even if my pace is slower than I expect, I just have to check off 5k and then I can do whatever the hell I want because at least it's a short day and it'll be over before I know it once I actually get out there and run. Tomorrow is Tuesday. Training plan says 10k at marathon pace. Gross. I tell myself that all I have to do is \"check off\" this workout and my reward is that for the next two days, I get a short run and a rest day! Hooray. I can get through entire weeks like that. And by forcing myself to do my actual long run slowly (30 to 60 min/mi slower than goal pace), I can go for longer, and I actually look forward to it. \n\nAlso, I know you said you haven't found any podcasts you like, so here's a podcast-running tip from someone who also struggled to find podcasts that I liked. During the pandemic I've gotten really addicted to certain television shows. Instead of trying to motivate myself to listen to \"intellectual\" podcasts on a run (I'm already suffering, damn it; I don't have the mental fortitude to learn things!) I found a couple of humorous podcasts that recap television shows I've been watching. That way I sort of feel like I'm watching TV while I'm running. Kind of stupid (and obviously doesn't work for everyone), but it helped me get through some of the longer runs!",

Running was too scary because I felt too vulnerable, even with pepper spray & dog treats & running in my own neighborhood. On my bike I was still on guard & paranoid (at first) but I felt a lot more comfortable because I could move past houses with barking dogs more quickly, & I knew that if a dog started to approach me I could dismount & keep the bike between myself & the dog (& then hopefully distract it by throwing treats or incapacitate it with pepper spray). It was a way for me to stay active outdoors & gradually start to feel safe again. Exposure to the same kinds of dogs in safe settings helped as well, even though it’s not the same as a dog on the loose it was helpful to relearn that not all dogs are aggressive. The number one most important thing is to keep going, keep facing your fear a little at a time. It takes a lot longer for the brain to recover from trauma than the body, but you’ll get there.

Once you think you're recovered, wait another few days to a week. Rather over-recover & get back at it later v/s under-recover, keep trying, make the injury worse/acquire new injury & get back at it even later\n* Were you running on a treadmill previously and transitioned to outdoors running when shutdown happened? Treadmills tend to cushion your tread & \"pull\" you along faster than you might run on your own, making outdoors running a rude awakening\n* Are you doing any strength training to with your running? Even BW lunges, squats, etc... can help. Also any yoga/pilates? Likewise how's your warm-up/cool-down? \n* Not knowing anything about you at all, 3 x 4k weekly seems like a lot of mileage for someone who just started running a few months ago. Maybe try to mix it up with different types of runs 3x week instead (longs/slow, fartlek/sprints, moderate 5k) to make it less repetitive?\n* Ankle strengthening & stretches are the jam! [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnUw1oHqwUA) helped me over come my pain, but play around and see what helps in your situation. If you go to the doctor you may have a better idea of what stretches work best, but sometimes you just have to do some trial & error until you get it right.\n* What's your form like? Check your old running shoe tread to see if you have any issues & spend some time googling correct running form/cues. If walking isn't painful you may be able to try some of them at a slower pace to start building the mind/muscle connections.\n\n**MOST IMPORTANTLY**, one injury does not mean you are not a runner. Injuries are bound to happen in any sport given enough time practicing it. The fact that your ran & still want to run makes you a runner. Just view this as a minor set back & use the recovery time to plan how you want to achieve future running goals!",

(If any of this is redundant for you, my apologies.)\n\nIT band type pain is very common but not well understood. First of all, is it on the outside of the knee? If not, it could be another type of runners knee.\n\nIn general IT band issues aren’t well understood in terms of cause. We *think* the band/muscle is rubbing a bursa sack in the knee, which gets inflamed and causes that sharp pain.  But it’s possible this isn’t the only cause.\n\nPTs will often prescribe a one-size-fits-all regiment of foam rolling and IT band stretches, but it doesn’t work for a lot of people. And there’s not a good correlation between how short or tight someone’s IT band is, and if they experience running pain in the knee. In other words, some people with very tight IT bands don’t have pain, which suggests that the tightness of the band might not cause all, or even most, cases of the condition.\n\nI had this for years and a good PT finally helped me figure out that one of my legs is slightly shorter. I run with a very subtle lift in one shoe now, and it almost entirely solved the problem for me. I think, in retrospect, that my knee was collapsing slightly inward on each step and causing inflammation around the bursa sack. But this discovery was after years of foam rolling and trying to stretch that did nothing for me, and I couldn’t run over 2 miles at a time for about a decade. I basically gave up running. But now I’m doing a lot!\n\nThe other thing that really helped was hip strengtheners (clamshell move with a resistance band) and mid-run stretching. Now when I feel tightness coming on, it’s up in my hips and also a bit in my knee, and if I stop mid-run to stretch my glute/hips for 1-3 minutes, I can often extend my run way longer than I could without the mid-run stretch. I usually stretch every 6 miles right now (used to be more often, like every mile when I started).\n\nIn the end, you need to experiment to see what helps you.  Commit to a therapy for 2-4 weeks consistently, and if you see no improvement, move on. Try different therapies for other potential causes of this condition until you deduce your underlying cause by hitting on the right combo of therapies. Most people can recover from this problem, just be persistent (and I hope your trainer or PT will experiment with you and make helpful suggestions!).\n\nGood luck 🍀",

My goal is sub-4 based on Garmin and HM result. \n\nI just raced my first HM last weekend. As it’s part of my marathon training, I did it with no taper. I was surprised how easy it was. Garmin was predicted around 1:55. They didn’t have a pacer for that, so I went with the 1:50 pacer and had several conversation throughout the first 8 miles. Helped to not be looking at my watch as used the pacers. The one I was chatting with around that 8 miles mark advised me to go for it then if I felt good because the final 3 miles we very undulating with quite a hill in the final mile with about 1/2 mile to go after you reach the top. I felt the hill, but everything felt so good and too easy. I finished 1:48:55 and thought I probably could’ve gone with the 1:45 pacer. That said, prefer to play it a bit safe the first go to make sure I finish strong. It was similar with my first 10k race. Stuck with the 60 min pacer and finished very strong in the final 2km to finish in 57 mins. I was battling the elements of a storm so played it very safe but felt good at the end as though I could’ve gone sub 55 if I had paced for it. \n\nI’m excited to complete my first set of races with my marathon in May. I’m hoping going for sub-4 will go well. Plan to stick with the 4hr pacer to take my mind off my watch and enjoy taking in my surrounding. Then a week off followed by a gait analysis and getting a strength plan together before I start training for another half in October. I’ll be adding more speed work.",

Perhaps the adrenaline of the crowd.\nYou’re really only going to be able to properly assess what made it so easy after you’ve done another one or more, perhaps in different conditions, or perhaps going for a loftier goal nearer the sub-4-hour mark.\nJust enjoy not having to get up and grind out some training miles for the next couple of weeks, you’ve earned the rest and you will still GAIN fitness in your body from the marathon for another week or so. Then you’ll start losing it if you don’t run, I think they say about ten days of inactivity before you start losing the fitness, something like that.\n\nIf you don’t mind me asking, what training plan did you do, how many kms/miles per week were you at at the pointy end of the training before the taper, what was your longest training run, what was your pacing strategy on the day (pos/neg split or just same steady pace from km 1 to km 42?) and what did you fuel with during the race and how often? Sorry, many questions there.\nI’m training for my own first in a couple of months and would like some idea if I am on the right track to hopefully have a similarly good experience as you, on race day.

If you can, add a 5th run, and add some mileage slowly to your other easy runs. Aim to progress SLOWLY to 40mpw over months. \n3. Volume at intensity. For me the key to a well executed half is miles at threshold. 6-8 X 1k at threshold and work up. My preferred plan would have alternating weeks. 1- two decent threshold sessions during the week and the long run is all easy or easy into steady. 2- one pretty big threshold session and a progressive long run of at least 10 miles with a significant chunk at half mrathon pace. This should be a hard workout requiring appropriate rest, fueling and recovery. I would say once you have your volume a bit higher aim to work up to AT LEAST 15km per week at half marathon pace and faster. \n\n3 gels is a bit meaningless when that could be anything from 60g to 150g of carbs. \n\nI like to aim for 60-80g an hour for longer races but at half have had more gastric distress than bonks so have been fine at 60g  for the whole 82-85 minutes. \n\n\nThe advice about the first 15k being easy wasn't working hard enough, a properly executed half marathon should be close enough to your LT2 that it's noticeable from the second or third km.",

Have to force myself to do it, even if I end up doing it slower than I want to. Because that’s the ultimate mental and physical preparation and pre rice for race day, knowing I CAN slow down to make it across the finish line if I think that’s what’s needed on the day. The best part of this training wearing you down is that you are almost there at the peak of the mountain, and then you get to taper, recover a bit; let that delayed fitness build over days, your mitochondria adjusting upwards from runs you did a week or more ago. And that last week before the marathon you relax, focus on sleeping well, hydrating enough every single day of that week; and just doing little shake-out runs to keep your legs ticking  over, no massive miles; no three hour runs. Just priming your energy stores for that last push on race day.\n\nThat’s the thing about a marathon. If you’ve done it right, it’s not 26 miles, or 42.2kms long.

April '24 ran a 3:58 marathon.\n\n**Training**  \nI trained with a running coach for about 6 months. 3 of that was base building, just getting the general fitness up, gradually increasing volume etc, so that for the last three months, I knew my body could handle the volume and intensity of stuff.  \n  \nIn the actual marathon training phase, weekly volume was 40 - 60km. I was running 4x a week, and strength training 2x. The usual split of a long run, speed session, and various easy runs for volume, with the long runs growing each week up to 35km.\n\nMost beneficial were definitely the long runs. Just to build the confidence of going a further distance than ever before. It was like 'last week I hadn't ran 25km, now I have. Why should running 28km be any different?'.\n\n**Nutrition**  \nOther than spending a long time really drilling my race fuelling (every long run for 6 months, the same gels, same flavours, same intervals), I really just followed the maxim of 'eat when you're hungry'. Good quality whole foods, lots of carbs, rice, pasta etc, lots of protein. Also, I stopped drinking alcohol. Avoiding alcohol made my sleep better, helped my recovery, and made a difference getting out the door every Sunday for that long run without the foggy head. \n\nI also never turned down sleep. 8 hours a night, minimum. Also, pro tip. After your long run, get in, refuel, shower, then have a 20 minute nap. No more, just enough to take the edge off, and you'll feel better for the rest of the day. \n\n**Mental Prep**  \nHaving a coach, or something to handle the programming for you is a massive boon (Runna, the training plan stuff on Garmin, Coros etc). Just to free up a bit of mental space so you don't have to worry about the 'right training'. Let someone else deal with that, and all you need to do is turn up and put the miles in. \n\nKnow that you will get sick. Or tired. Or injured. Or life will happen. Something will get in the way. And that's fine. Its expected. One bad run, one bad week doesn't write the whole thing off. Accept that your training won't be perfect. Try as hard as you can to make it perfect, but accept that it won't be. And that it'll still work.\n\nThe **most** important thing is to get out do the work regardless of how you feel (unless your genuinely sick or injured). Don't wait for motivation. If you feel like shit, go for the run. If you're feel tired, go for the run anyway. If you feel great, go for the run.\n\n**Pitfalls**  \nTraining for a marathon is a mammoth task. Don't get me wrong, its worth it, but its a massive undertaking. It can be so easy to lose yourself in that bubble, and forget that it also requires the people around you to make compromises to accomodate you. I had to run every weekend morning for 6 months. I lost a lot of time with my partner to go running. We'd cancel plans because I had a race on the next day. She would always be the one to make dinner on Sunday because I was out running. What I'm trying to say is, it'll take up a LOT of your time, but try not to let it take over your life. Show the people around you that you're grateful for their patience and the sacrifices they are making to support you. \n\nAlso. When you cross the finish line, it's the best feeling in the world. It really is. But it leaves a massive hole. A hole where all that structure and training and adrenaline and effort towards a goal used to be. If you aren't careful, that you can fall into that hole. Post marathon blues are real. The come down is real. Make sure that you have some plans for after. Book a holiday, enter another race, indulge a different hobby, but just make sure that after the necessary bit of rest, you pick yourself back up and pursue something else for a while.   \n  \nTrust the process.

Most (decent) plans are very similar with regard to quantity and quality. Make sure you run easy when you should and fast when you are supposed to. Train to race, don’t race to train.\n\n#2 marathon pace in long runs. Your plan should include this but if not, do. Split your training calendar in two (if you don’t start off with a full race calendar - pretend I added that as a point) and in the second half add segments of marathon pace to your long runs.\n\n#3 there is a secret to speed work - do it. Some days you will fly. Some days you will not. Keep it up and aim for your time but don’t beat yourself up if you don’t hit those marks. Thought here is you’re not supposed to red line so to speak. Technically you really shouldn’t ever put forth over 95% for training runs. You’re working out not maxing out. Can’t do that every week and stay healthy.\n\n#4 stress is a factor. Your day to day can be stressful at times (think work, relationships, family, etc) and can impact a run regardless of sleep or nutrition. That’s also an example. Other unplanned influences can throw off your pace, motivation, or endurance. Again don’t beat yourself up! Any run is faster than sitting on the couch!\n\nHope that helps. Cheers and good luck!",

I got injured during my training block due to focusing on getting my workouts in (tempo/interval). What I should have focused on was getting my volume in sustainably. At the first sign of trouble I should have subbed in more easy miles. I ended up on the start line in much worse shape than I had hoped, but I had learned some valuable lessons. This year I have focused on sustainable volume over speed workouts and I’m in much better shape than I was at this point last year. In order to progress you need to be consistent, and in order to be consistent you must be healthy.\n\nOne thing I remember very clearly from my marathon was at roughly mile 22 I thought to myself “why did I ever even have a time goal?! This is so brutal, I just want to get to the finish”. I had a new found deep respect for anyone who has finished a marathon, regardless of their time. Nothing can prepare you physically or mentally for the anguish you will experience during the last 6 miles… it’s awesome.\n\nI’ll try and answer you specific questions:\n- last year’s peak was a write-off, but this year I aim to peak at 75km per week (so just shy of 50mpw).\n- nutrition was huge. Last year I focused on protein for recovery and growth, this year I am stronger and I feel that focusing on carbs during higher mileage weeks has been more beneficial. Not a nutritionist.\n- training is tough, but my mantra was “just get out the door, that’s the worst bit”. In terms of getting through the race, I can’t really remember. I had a brush with ‘the wall’ and got tunnel vision. I just kept turning the legs over and tried not to focus on the pain.\n- common pitfalls I know of would be going out too fast, thinking that your feeling so fresh at the halfway point that you speed up considerably, and not sticking to a tried and tested fuelling strategy.\n- time commitment - you can find the time, but you may need to get creative and be flexible. It doesn’t end at the running either. You must find time for strength training if you want to avoid injury, and foam rolling, massaging, stretching etc etc.",

Maybe I'm an exception but I've found it much better to run according to my body, and then occasionally pushing to a new weekly mileage when I feel good, then holding that until I'm ready to push again.\n\nMy progression has gone (km) 20, 20, 35, 44, 42, 43, 55, (two weeks illness), 52, 52, 58, 80, 70, 71. One jump up to 40, hold, jump to 50, hold, jump to 70, hold. First two jumps were adding recovery days, final jump was adding a third quality workout (medium-long run).\n\nTouchwood, no injuries yet. It requires one tough week at the new benchmark, and then the next couple weeks feel easier. If they don't feel easy you can drop a bit lower like how I've levelled off at 70 after a push to 80km.\n\nFunnily enough 20*(1.1^15) = 76km so I'm roughly where I would be following a strict 10% rule but I would have been increasing every single week instead of having multiple deloads in intensity or distance.\n\nIf you do prefer to aim for a set 10% then I would at least suggest a deload every 3-4 weeks where you maintain your last week's mileage or slightly reduce it.",

In a way, unless we get struck by lightning all injuries are our own fault. Also, sometimes injuries just happen and maybe it would have happened anyway even with the correct mileage.\n\nMy advice to you is that you separate those events mentally, in case you choose to not run you are not \"giving up again\". You did not give up the first time, and you would not be giving up now either - only you know your priorities and if the prep means sacrificing other things then you have to prioritize what is best for you",

It felt really personalised to my ability and really helped me improve my speed and endurance. The fact that it also reads out my pace to me through my headphones was a big win during interval sessions. \n\nThe mental side is definitely challenging. My motivation dipped around 4 weeks before the marathon and this was where the injuries started creeping in. What helped me was listening to David Goggin’s book and practicing gratitude (replacing negative thoughts with thankful/positive thoughts).\n\nI also found it really encouraging to know how much power you have over your own mind. It’s like a muscle, train it alongside your physical training regime and you will be equipped with great mental strength! \n\nYou will smash this marathon!!",

It's a great app and not too expensive and will give you a decent plan that will get you over the finish line. If you're aiming for sub 4 I'd suggest running at least 4 days a week, ideally 5 if you can, but of course build up to 5 days if you're only running 3 right now - don't go straight to 5! Main thing is to focus the majority of your mileage on easy running - truly easy, zone 2 heart rate running. For somebody aiming for a sub 4 marathon that would probably sit somewhere between 6:10/km-6:30/km. Only 1 of your runs a week needs to be speed focused - for your first marathon especially, it's way better to average say 45-50 miles a week with 80% of that at an easy pace than 35 miles a week with only 50% of that at an easy pace. Also massively reduces your risk of injury! SO many people get injured in training for their first marathon because they're running higher mileage than they've ever run before and running it way too hard, you have to focus on lots of easy miles in marathon training.\n\nTo be honest the mental side is pretty individual. For me, my confidence just built naturally over the block. Before I ran my first marathon I'd run 20 miles twice, 18 miles twice and 16 miles twice in training and felt ok at the end of most of them - so I was pretty confident I'd be fine on the day (and I was!), but I was still absolutely terrified! Manchester has massive crowds though so you'll be fine.",

As a rule of thumb, increase your weekly mileage slowly (around 10%). So if you run 15 miles one week, aim for 16.5 - 17 miles the next week. \n\nAs others have pointed out, marathon training can be 16-20 weeks long - depending on what you follow. \n\nVary your run efforts (hard and easy), work on hills. Aside from that, work on your core, strength training and cross training and give your body a day of rest every week. \n\nYou will get all kinds of advice and more than one person can be right. Just do what feels good for you in a way that you can progress and be injury-free. \n\nGood luck!",

Try to schedule a half marathon race between weeks 8-12, the middle of the training plan.\n\nThe typical plan will have you running 4-5x week, 3 easy runs, a speed day, and a long run. I’d start “pre” training by running 2-3 miles, 3-4x week. On the off days, do a little cross training, stretching, nothing too intense. \n\nRun hard, rest hard. Stick to the plan.\n\nThe biggest mistake most runners make is going too hard on the easy run days, which limits recovery and leads to injury. Easy is easy! Afterwards, it should feel like you didn’t even run that day. Easy runs should be fun! Hard days are hard, push yourself and you will feel it. I typically plan a rest day after my speed day and after my long run day. \n\nIf your goal is to finish, you can choose to do an easy run instead of speed training. Speed really only helps if you’re looking for a goal time. Marathons are more endurance, fueling, and mental. Long runs should be the most important run of the week. The easy runs are to build up your muscle base in preparation for the long run. ~30+ miles a week in the plan is typical as you get closer to race day. \n\nBut If you do want a target finish time, in general, they say if you can finish a HM with ~1:50, you can do a 4hr. Using that same ratio based on your HM finish, I’d say 5:30 is very achievable. But with a strong training plan and no major injury, I’d say under 5hr is within reason.\n\nGood luck! It’s a very rewarding experience, and something less than 1% of the entire world has ever done!",

My reoccurring foot generalized ache is pretty much completely gone . I started slowing myself down after a Half Marathon Race in 2:12 that felt HARD and I was truly drained at the end so realized I needed to tweak what I was doing overall/change my expectations to make it a farther distance.\n\nMy recent long run was 14 miles and felt good throughout- with my average pace at 12:45/mile. Although, some my relaxed runs have been closer to an average of 13:50.\n\nMaybe give it a try to even slow more for your long runs and see what it does- I know sticking to a lower pace, or seeing my pace hit 15:00/mile on a hill, can be super mentally challenging but I am trying reframe it as remaining healthy and uninjured to prep and if all goes well hit those more expected/faster paces on race day.  (Or maybe for future marathons,).  This week I have a 16 mile, with 12 miles at \"race pace\" so we will see how I fare picking it up a notch again.\n\nThen, I am on Hokas with overpriced PF insoles. I wear Cliftons for most of my runs and virtually always generally wear Hoka Bondis especially in recovery post runs.  The cushioned running shoe post run has been really helpful to my general aches and pains too.\n\nGood luck!",

I trained twice a week for 5 months, with my longest run being 17 miles just over a month ago. I limped the final two miles of that one after, like you, I got searing shooting pains in my left knee.\n\nOn Sunday, I got to the halfway point when I felt the twinge returning. As with you, I thought it was in my head, and persevered, getting to the 17-mile mark again before the searing was too much, and I stopped, doing as Ok-Baseball has said below and putting my health before a medal. 3 days later, I'm feeling okay. My legs aren't in pieces like they were after my training run, but my knee's still stiff and I have small twinges every now and then. Again, just like you, I drive a manual car and after the drive to work (40ish minutes) it's aggravating the knee a lot. I'm a bit pissed off with myself for stopping, you're right, it feels a little anti-climatic, and there's a part of me that's saying I should've just kept going, but hindsight's a wonderful thing.\n\nBased on nothing but what I'm doing for myself, I'd say take a bit of a break to rest and heal up properly, but don't stop running completely. I'm not about to hate-book another marathon immediately just because I'm annoyed I didn't finish this one, but I've signed myself up for some small local park runs, with the target of building up again to do a Half Marathon just before Christmas. Then, next year, when I'm healed up fully, and fitter and stronger than I am now, I can go for the 26.2. I'm also looking for the positives in my experience. I signed up for it, I trained for it, I showed up with every intent on finishing it, and even though I didn't, I went further than I've gone before, and got a PR in the Half Marathon, so it's progress all the same.\n\nThere's loads of marathons out there - try not to place a voluntary deadline on yourself by booking another one so soon. You've obviously got the drive to do one because you've already signed yourself up to do one in the first place - use this time to learn from the experience, cool down, heal, and properly prep yourself for smashing your first one. \n\nWell done for where you've got to already, and how far you're going to go - you've got this!",

Some people have perfect first ones, often something happens (cramps etc) and you finish slower than expected. It is a physically and mentally taxing experience. \n\nI think you need to figure out why you want to run. It’s nice to have a pacer or group to hang with but it’s not something that’s strictly necessary. As someone who ran competitively in school, the idea of making a friend during a race hits weird - if you’re going at a pace where you can talk comfortably that’s probably not the fastest you can go/your best effort.\n\nIf running is just social for you that’s fine. But if you actually want to hit a specific time/pace you probably have to have more internal motivation happening, it can’t just be “oh but my friend wasn’t there and then I lost my new friend too.” My first marathon, to me, taught me how many reserves I had internally that I could call on to achieve something difficult. I stopped to walk at one point and realized I was moving faster than the other walkers, and could probably just run the rest. I realized I wasn’t hurt or overtired just a little uncomfortable.\n\nI wouldn’t call a marathon fun exactly, or the coolest thing I’ve ever done. You get a sense of achievement, but it is work during the race. I don’t know that races even where you get a runner’s high are ‘fun’ exactly? The friends you train with, that’s fun. But even when I think about like high school cross country, throwing up after a race where you pushed yourself wasn’t fun. I had a teammate who lost a shoe during a race, that wasn’t fun.

It won't give you that same boost, but reminding yourself that you're doing something good for your running *every day* can be really helpful. I also found it useful to keep a calendar, marking off each day that I did something positive, so I could see how much good I was doing.\n\nI don't know if this is useful, but I hope it is, at least a little.

I was just stubborn.

I ran slow and steady, about a 12:30mph pace and finished just under 5:30. I was so proud of myself. You will be too! Afterwards it’s time to focus on recovery and if you ever run another marathon you might want to think strongly about strength training- I know that’s what I need more than anything.

Or have I officially lost my marbles?\n\n100% possible. \n\nI went from casual short-distance running of 5km end of last year, to running my first last Sunday.\n\nCouch to 5km: 9 weeks  - gets you 0 to 5km\n\nHal Higdon Novice: 18 weeks - gets you \\~10km to 42.2km\n\nThat's 27 weeks... 6 months...  You'll want to spend the rest of the time getting LOTS of km's under your belt so you can not just survive, but thrive during the marathon. \n\nYou could do a 5km to 10km transition in between as well.\n\nI was already running parkrun (join parkrun!!) and up to about 10-15km in Nov/Dec last year.  I can't remember when I decided to run a marathon, but it was somewhere around Nov 22 - Mar 23.  I then used the Hal Higdon plan as a basis, modified a little to suit my lifestyle and with The Running Channels plan which had some features I liked.   When I did this, I was still 2-3 months before the plan started, so I filled the gap with gradually increasing load to build up tolerance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I’m concerned about injuring my knees and ankles when I start running. Is traditional weight lifting and stretching sufficient to build up that strength in my joints?\n\nTry and keep your increase in km's <10% on average across the rolling four weeks.  It might jump up and down... but a slow and steady increase is key to preventing injury, adapting and building up tolerance. \n\nYou'd be best to find a physio near you.  If you come up with any injuries, niggles, concerns, etc... having them around will help diagnose and treat issues.  \n\nI've had a few different issues, however I'm over 40 and overweight.  \n\nI've got a local PT that I've been seeing every \\~3 weeks and they've been really great diagnosing and fixing problems.  They also designed a training session that I do 1-2 times a week, focusing on my legs, to strengthen them.  Weight lifting isn't necessary, bodyweight exercises are great.\n\nMidway through my training journey, I started getting bad knee pain after 9km.  They worked out the issue and used dry needling - the problem went away and I was able to run for 3 weeks before it returned.  Now I think my body has adapted and it no longer presents.  \n\nSo the PT can help from having your training get de-railed!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I have a general idea about what my training schedule and phases should look like but it seems different sites give varying info. Is there any consensus about a “holy grail” of running resources that would be a good beginners guide to building out my training?\n\n[https://fellrnr.com/wiki/A\\_Comparison\\_of\\_Marathon\\_Training\\_Plans](https://fellrnr.com/wiki/A_Comparison_of_Marathon_Training_Plans)\n\nHere is a good site to compare different plans and how they might suit  you (and which to avoid).\n\nThere isn't one \"holy grail\", there are several which people will recommend. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>What were the biggest mistakes or unforeseen consequences when you started running?\n\nGoing to hard, to fast.  You're cardio fitness improves at a different rate to your soft tissue (muscles, tendons, ligaments, etc).   Many beginners often go to hard thinking they're fine (good cardio), without giving their legs a chance to adapt to the new pressures.\n\nIgnoring issues or mis-diagnosis.  Don't post on reddit asking about possible solutions to your knee pain.  'Referred pain' means that your knee might be in pain, but the cause isn't the knee, it's from another part of the biomechanical chain.  For me, my knee pain was caused by tight ITB/etc bands - dry needling my quads, tendons and hips is what cured it.  Go seek professional advice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Miscellaneous advice?\n\nI enjoy watching The Running Channel\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/@runningchannel](https://www.youtube.com/@runningchannel)\n\nYour long runs are the time you need to learn and understand;\n\n* What hitting the wall (bonking) feels like - when you run out of glycogen (energy stores) and move to fat burning.  This is probably 1-1.5hrs into your run.\n* Fueling to avoid the above.  Food, gels, etc.... try different things and see what works for you.\n* Pre-run and Post-run fueling.\n* NOTHING NEW ON RACE DAY - Your training is the time to test everything out.\n* What clothes, shoes, socks to wear - what works for you.\n* Chafing and how to deal with it. I got caught off guard when suddenly 3/4 into a long run I got seriously bad nipple chaffing.  I've now worked out products/solutions that work for me.\n* Track the km's in your runners.  Runners have a finite life.  Your feet may tell you when they're at the end of their life.  Recently I spoke to Brooks at a HM event and they said my shoes could go for 1,000km.  I got about 1,100km out of them (I just ran my first marathon in them) and so I'll now go and get them replaced.  They have shown no indications of issues earlier, I should've replaced them earlier anyway, but just never got around to it.  Other runners may have a life of 500km or even lower (special race shoes).\n* Sign up to 10km and half marathon events to test your progress and get an idea of your current pacing/times.  This can be put into calculators which will adjust and tell you your predicted marathon pace/time, which you can use to inform the remainder of your training and pacing strategy. Often people will say to take your half marathon time, double it and add \\~20 min... to get your marathon time.  \n\nGood luck!",

I'm currently beginning the taper for a December 9 marathon. I feel your pain.\n\nIn terms of clothing, the answer for long runs is layers and a running vest like the Salomon Advanced Skin 12. The inner layer should be a long sleeve base layer like UnderArmour's Cold Gear or SmartWool. Above that, a synthetic long sleeve shirt shirt or fleece that zips up through the neck. Your outer layer should be a wind/water blocking jacket that doesn't have any thermal properties. You can find inexpensive ones from Baleaf on Amazon, often advertised for bicyclists. Take it off if you get too warm on your long runs and store it in your vest.\n\nFor gloves, I suggest wearing a warm liner glove under a mitten shell. The separate double layers are warmer than wearing only one glove or mitten alone. For the feet, waterproof socks are better for keeping out winter cold than even wool. Winter is also the one time where Gore-Tex versions of running shoes are worth it for keeping out cold wind and snow. Also, traction devices such as Kahtoola Nanospikes are essentially on ice and packed snow.\n\nThe grey days make winter running mentally tough. The best piece of advice I can give you is to focus on the first 5K/3 miles. Make a plan for your long run but tell yourself you can quit after 5K if it's too much for you. The vast majority of the time once you get to 5K, you're going to be feeling much better. Running outdoors in the winter in cold weather like running outdoors in mid-summer in hot weather builds stronger runners.",

Even if you have to drive somewhere to get to the run to make it a new place/route it will be more interesting.  I found a couple of beautiful routes within 30 minutes of my house that made for a fun change.\n\nAlso I found Audiobooks to be extremely interesting on those longer runs.  So much so that on Marathon day the first 20 miles I listened to an audiobook rather than podcasts or music.  I switched to music when things started to feel a bit tougher for the last 10k.",

Physical therapy not only helps rehab an injury, but it's the best insurance policy you can have in terms of staying injury-free.

For example say your long run is to do 20 miles and your at mile 15 and your legs feel tired and you want to stop, just tell yourself okay just make it to miles 16, then when you get there say ok now 16.5, etc etc. eventually you’ll hit 20 and be done. \n\nAlso if you just accept the fact that it’s gonna hurt sometimes but it’s just part of the deal it will help to strengthen you mentally.

The full marathon is May 1 and I will be one of the last people crossing the finish line. 6:30 is the cutoff.

Many marathon training plans are 3-6 months long. \n\nThe marathon is such a different beast compared to every other distance. Any other distance you can bullshit your way through it unprepared and untrained. In the marathon that’s pretty hard to do; confidence only takes you so far.\n\nIt requires so much very careful training in order to avoid injury but also build the stamina needed for 26 miles. Stress fractures are common among runners who try to up their mileage or speed too fast. \n\nThe good news though is that there are so many more opportunities once you’re recovered! You can always return to the marathon distance. I’d recommend joining a local runners club or a local marathon training program.\n\nEdit: My apologies, I just saw you built to 35k, 21 miles.

                    "body": "1. This is a bit of an unusual situation, and using a pre-written plan probably won't be ideal. Personally, I'd play it by ear - stick to the same kind of routine you did before the race, in terms of week structure, and dial the volume up or down as needed. The idea is to train as much as you can handle, but definitely not more - in fact, you really can't expect much more in this short amount of time than to carry the fitness from ultra training over to your marathon. Most likely, you can build up a lot more aggressively now than you did before - your body is still used to doing 50km weeks, so after a week or two of recovering and easing in, you may be able to be back at peak mileage. Also keep in mind that you do want to taper for the marathon, so with a 2-week buildup and a 2-week taper, you only have 2 full weeks of proper training anyway, which means that whatever you do won't matter all that much. Aim to maintain, everything on top of that is a nice bonus, but it won't be much.\n2. 2 weeks out is the standard advice, and it tends to work out well for me at least. Some people need more, some can do with less, but I'd go with 2 weeks unless you know better yourself.\n3. I'd do pace runs separately, so \"long slow distance\". Then again, with a 4:00 goal time, the difference between \"easy\" and \"marathon\" paces isn't going to be huge anyway, so definitely don't obsess about this. As far as distance / duration goes, this is hard to say, and philosophies disagree here; IMO, a good distance for the long run is one where you reach the \"man, this sucks big hairy donkey balls\" point, get past it, and then run a little more, but not so much as to completely blow up or require more than a day of recovery. 20 miles is traditional, but people book good successes with longest long runs much shorter or longer. Given your scheduling limitations, I would just play this one by ear too - feel it out while building back up, see how, say, a 25k goes, and then based on that decide how long to go for the final long run.",

                    "body": "> Is 2 weeks enough time for taper?\n\nGenerally; yes, 2 weeks is about ideal. If you had trained a bit too hard, a longer or more extreme taper might be in order; and if this wasn't a proper goal race, and your main focus is on the next race after it, you would do a shorter taper and pace the race more conservatively. But normally, 2 weeks is the standard recommendation.\n\n> I feel like I need one more long run mainly for confidence boosting, and after that I will be mentally ready to taper for two weeks. However, I have trained hard and don't want to sabotage my marathon.\n\nDon't worry, you'll be fine. Whatever training you can bring to the starting line has to be in the bank by now, but if you've been training well, doing one more (moderately) long run won't ruin things for you, and 2 weeks will be enough to recover fully. So whether you do this long run or not is not going to make a huge difference, physiologically speaking. If it gives you a mental boost, do it; if it doesn't, then don't. If in doubt, running too little during the taper is better than running too much.\n\n> Also, as far as a time goal, I am hoping to run a sub 4 hour marathon. My half marathon time was 1:44, 10k time is 45 minutes, however my long runs (15 miles plus) have come out to about 10 minute miles. I was definitely tired by the end of my 20 miler, and now I'm concerned I won't be able to pull of 9 min/mile pace for the full marathon. Advice?? Am I shooting too high, or will adrenaline help me on race day?\n\nTraining runs aren't races. During training, you are in a constant state of fatigue, you never recover fully. This is by design, because it's the best way to stimulate training adaptations - enough rest to keep the adaptations going, but not so much as to reduce the effect of training stress. (Google \"supercompensation\" for the traditional reasoning behind this). As a result, you are never running at your full potential during training; some fatigue is always shadowing your true progress. In the race, however, you will be fully rested; you have been tapering for two weeks, so the full training benefits kick in just in time for the race, and you have gotten rid of the fatigue by reducing your training load and resting well. You can now also afford to put in so much effort that you need a week or more of recovery after, way more than you would want during training, where the next run is never more than 2 days away. Adrenaline and focus help with that last part.\n\nThen again, overestimating all this can easily ruin your race. The marathon is very much about energy management, especially stored carbs; if you head out too fast, the fat-burning energy machinery doesn't get a chance to fire up to full capacity, and you'll spend your carbs early and crash long before the finish is in sight. So I'd suggest heading out at 10:00/mi (which is a pace you should be able to easily maintain for the entire race, if need be), hold for at least the first few miles, and then gently speed up to target pace by feel. Don't go faster than that until at least the halfway point; and when you reach that point, check how you feel, and pace accordingly. Feeling great? Speed up a little (but not too much - 5-10 seconds per mile is a lot already). Feeling OK? Maintain pace. Things getting hard already? Slow down, you've still got the hard bits ahead of you. Either way, hold back until mile 20; from there, anything you can muster the strength for is going to be an OK pace.\n\nThat's all assuming a flat course; if either part of the race is significantly harder than the rest, you will of course need to adjust your pacing strategy. E.g., if there's a bunch of steep hills in the second half, you'd try to bank some time in the first half and then go slower on the hills.",

Your body is fairly resistant, this went about as well as it could have, but doing this over and over will increase the odds of injury substantially. \n\nEdit: also a general safety tip: **Don’t drive home after a marathon.** I don’t care if you’re an Olympian, if your muscles are tired your reaction times are lowered.

Replace whatever time of day you normally went running with some walking, yoga, stretching, foam rolling, a little extra core work, etc. Don't just sit around waiting to get better, this will a) not help you get better very quickly and b) drive you fucking insane.

I am definitely not a runner--I was running to raise money for a charity and also just for the challenge--so I wasn't worried about time or anything. I just legitimately dreaded the thought of having to run that long. \n\nThe night before, I was talking about this with my brother-in-law (a serious runner who's done several marathons and BQed this year), and he gave me advice that changed my whole perspective. \n\nHe said training and prepping was the boring stuff, but running the marathon--that's the victory lap. That's when you can celebrate everything you've done that brought you to that point and just enjoy the experience. \n\nIt really helped me think of the race in a positive way, and when I got out there, I realized he was right. It wasn't all easy, but it was an amazing experience.\n\nI hope this helps! Good luck to you!\n\nEdit: \"raise money for a charity\" not \"make money\"",

                    "body": "Great writeup. Hope it's not dickish of me to add paragraphs. Just makes it a little easier to read.\n\n>The Raleigh City of Oaks Marathon went down on Nov 2. This was my first marathon. I'm a 38 y/o long time competitive cyclist, but I only started running this June. I followed Hal Higdon's Novice marathon training program. \n\n>Things went well for the first several weeks. Then I had a bad ankle sprain that kept me off my feet for 2 weeks. 12 weeks prior to the marathon, I had a hip flexor strain followed by a strain of the other hip, which also kept me from running for another 4 weeks. After those injuries, things were fine, and I got in about 80% of the runs in the program, including all of the long runs. There was also a lot of cycling thrown in with the running. So training was not ideal, but OK. \n\n>Race day weather was cold in the 40's and a little windy but bright and sunny. Basically perfect weather. I decided to run with the 4:00 pace group as this was my goal from the beginning. But I got there a little late and didn't have a chance to talk with the pacers to see what their plan was. One guy had a rocking beard and an Umstead Ultra 100 tattoo on his calf so I assumed he knew what he was doing. Anyway, we line up and we're off. \n\n>The group took off at target pace. I immediately knew the pace was too fast. I can maintain 9:09 pace pretty easily, but I need to warm up for a mile or two. After trying to tough it out for 1 mile, I decide to just let them go while I get my legs warmed up, then up the pace a bit and catch back up. I assumed they'd try to keep 9:09 pace and I'd eventually catch them if I ran 8:50. I can't math while I'm running so I didn't know how long it would take. At 2 miles I already had to piss, and that took forever. But the first 11 miles of the race where through mostly gently rolling hills through the city, so I didn't expect this to be a problem. \n\n>At 4 miles, I could see the group again, but realized I'd over hydrated before the race and needed a pit stop again. Only 2 toilets there and 4 people waiting. Great. Finally pissed, back to running. Next several miles were uneventful, and I could see the pace group again, but I needed to piss again. Finally got to the 9 mile aid station and went, but this pit stop took much longer and I knew the group would be long gone. But I was still feeling very good and had been on my hydration/feeding schedule and decided to try to catch them again. \n\n\n>At 11 miles, the Half-Marathon and Marathon courses split, and we went onto the Raleigh Greenways. The greenway section was an out-n-back that started with a long downhill, totaling about three miles. Parts of it were really steep, which was going to suck on the way back. But I continued to press on and began to see people who had started with the group but must have fallen off the pace. Eventually I got back up to the 4:00 pace group about 16 miles in. Finally. At this point I could slow down and rest up a bit. I continued my feeding schedule which was to eat a GU every 30 minutes or if I felt hungry as long as my stomach could handle it. It didn't occur to me at the time, but focusing on chasing the pace group kept my mind occupied which mentally helped out. \n\n>The section of the greenway after the downhill between miles 15 to 20 were basically dead flat with the turnaround at 18 miles. This also mentally helped me divide the race into shorter segments. Miles 18 to 20 were uneventful, but I could see some other people in my group were getting fatigued. One guy must have had enough and abruptly stopped in front of me and I ran into him. Thanks dude. \n\n>At 20 miles, we begin to go back up the steep Greenway climbs. I personally like the hills, but I was a little nervous as the hardest part of the run would be a 20 miles, which was where most people's \"wall\" would be, and 20 miles was my longest run in training. There was a short downhill before the climb really started in earnest, and the pace group slowed down significantly, so I decided to go on at my own pace and hit the climbs at my own pace. Another guy who was running barefoot did the same, so I just followed him. The climbs were steep but not as quite bad as I had anticipated. I think getting a bit of \"rest\" with the group and continuing to eat the whole time helped. \n\n>But at 22 miles my stomach was starting to feel a bit off, not good or bad, just full. I decided not to push it and stopped eating at this point but kept drinking gatorade at the aid stations. Once back at the top of the hill, at 24 miles we're off the greenway and back onto city streets. Here you run out away from the finish line, make a u-turn, and run back the opposite direction on the same street to the finish line. Where is where I very abruptly started to feel really bad. My hamstrings felt tight from around mile 8, but now they were starting to hurt. Also, the trees on the greenway offered some shelter from the wind, which was now gone and I started feeling pretty cold. I'm still well ahead of the pace group, but I think they were making up time on me and I could tell I was slowing down on these short undulating hills. A couple people that were in the group and a few others I'd passed on the big climb passed me up, but the pacers were still behind me. \n\n>Eventually I see the finishing chute but didn't feel any better. At 26 miles I could see the time and knew that my 4:00 goal was close to slipping away so I try to pick up the pace for the last 0.2. But we also started about a minute after the gun so I knew I had a little time. I finally cross the line at 3:58:17. Awesome. I get my medal and l'm very happy. I also feel like both of my calves are about to explode which was strange as they didn't bother me at all during the run. \n\n>So I learned a few things. A slow start is important for me. If I'd tried to keep up with the pace group at the beginning, I think I would have blown up before the finish. I also had a negative split, but having to stop and piss several times contributed to that too. Eating often also helped, both mentally and physically. Overall the race was very well done and well organized. The volunteers were awesome. The pacers did a great job. I'll be back next year.",

I suspect the sights and the water and the excitement will help a lot.\n \nThere was a decent amount of crowd participation and the miles are often sponsored with fun stuff happening and great signs.  The race bling was also great.\n \nI found it to be really well run with good aid stations, water stops, etc.  Once you get to the OMG BRIDGE though, you may question all your life choices that lead you up to this point.  Recommendation: walk the fucking bridge.  You'll be all 'no no, Panthy, I got this shit' and then half way up you'll be all 'okay, yeah, she was right.'  Though, if you're mentally prepared it's not unreal awful.  You do have to stare at it for a while before actually taking the bridge as you come up on it!\n \nI don't have any recommendations as far as the race...but do try and hit Sam and Omie's while you're on OBX.  They have an amazing she crab soup and like everywhere else on the Outer Banks, all the seafood is fresh fresh fresh.\n \nAlso recommend waddling out to the water and putting your legs in to cool em off after the race.

Very cold to start, which meant you wanted to up your pace early to stay warm, especially for us in the purple corral who started at 9:05 and had twenty minutes of waiting around after the official start. Also just so many people to keep track of! The race only really opened up for me after the half marathoners finished. I was very lucky to have my Garmin to keep track of my pace, but even that died at around 35k. \n\nNevertheless, I thought it was a really well organized event and the spectators and volunteers were awesome and really kept me going. Really appreciated the powergel and the awesome Greek dancers. Had a huge steak after to celebrate and feel surprisingly ok. Sunday I had peg legs but now I'm pretty much back to normal.\n\nCongrats to you for persevering!!! If you feel like doing it again I'd really recommend the Midsummer Nights Run. It's a 30k sundowner run on a beautiful course and a great way of doing more than a half (which isn't that far), but not so much that it kills you.\n",
